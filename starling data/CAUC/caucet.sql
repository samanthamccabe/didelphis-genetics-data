However, the Ossetian source can not explain many phonetic features of its Caucasian counterparts (in particular, nasalisation present in most NC forms). It seems to us much more reasonable to suppose that the Ossetian form itself was borrowed from a Caucasian source (cf., e.g., PAT *‰əbəgV with secondary denasalisation). Later it was, in its turn, borrowed in some EC languages: cf. Cham. ‰ag (Gig. ‰agi), God. ‰ogi ''scythe'' - forms that are absolutely irregular compared to other EC forms, and can be easily derived from a source like Proto-Ossetian *‰avag.

        The PNC 1-st p. pronoun needs some comments. Like other personal
pronouns, it is characterized by unique phonetic features (voiced fricative in
PNC, the development *z > *d in Av.-And.-Tsez., Darg. and Lak. /where *d >
t:/). However, forms with *d- certainly can not be kept apart from forms with
*z, since morphologically they match each other very well.
      The  direct  stem  may be safely reconstructed  as  *z,
sporadically  with  a  pronominal suffix *-n -  *zn  (cf.  PA
*di-n,  PL *zo-n; on Lak. nu and Darg. nu see *nV). A possible
trace  of *-n is also the -ə vowel in PC: it probably reflects
*-ə~ < *--n with loss of nasalization (without it *-ɨ would be
expected  in  PC). The vowel -u- in Av. (du-n) and Darg.  (du)
should  best be explained by the influence of the 2-d p.  pro-
noun q.v.
      The  evidence of PN, PHU, PL and Khin. allows to recons-
truct  three different oblique stems for the 1-st p.  pronoun.
The one is *z- /PL *za- = PN *sa-(*s-)/, the other - *ʔez(V)
/PL  *-ez  = PHU *(j)es- = PN *ʔas = Khin. as/;  finally,  the
third  is *ʔiz(V) /PL gen. *-iz = Khin. i/e/. It is most  pro-
bable that the third stem is reflected in Darg. *di-, PC *di-,
PA  *di- (where it lost the initial vowel and became the gene-
ral oblique stem). In Lak. and HU, where the obl. stem is t:u-
and  *so- respectively, it is probably due to a merger of  PEC
dir. *z- and obl. *z-.
      We may present the following solution for this very complicated
picture. The original ergative was *ʔez(V), preserved in PN as *ʔas; in
PHU it became also nominative (merging of erg./nom. in pronouns is rather usual
in ergative languages). In PL and Khin. this stem shifted to dative - which is
parallel to the general shift of the PEC ergative case in *-s_V > PL dative
*-s: (note, however, that in Khin. the erg. form j probably still reflects
the same stem  *ʔez(V)). The obl. stem *z- then took upon itself
ergative functions in PL. Finally, the original genitive stem *ʔiz(V) was
preserved as such in PL, Khin and (with vowel loss) in PD, PA and PC; in all
other languages it was superseded by the general oblique stem *z-
(sometimes even by the dir. stem *z-).
      To sum up: PEC (PNC) dir. stem *z(-n); erg. stem *ʔez(V); gen.
stem *ʔiz(V); general oblique stem *z-.
