In Ub. \Iwə-sʷa\i 'metal' + 'white' = 'copper, bronze' : \Iwə-ʷa\i 'metal' + '?' = 'iron'. If we assume that the Ub. and AK words for 'iron' are genetically related (certainly, the theory of Ub. \Iwəʷa\i being an Adygh loanword, see Shagirov 1, 140, can not be considered seriously), the correspondence PAK * : Ub. ʷ is unambiguously pointing to the PWC lateral labialised *ʷ, for which the expected PAT correspondence is *ʷ - and we find it in PAT \I*ja-ʷa\i 'blue'.     The concept of iron being a "blue metal" is by no means strange: it goes back to one of the earliest varieties of tempered iron (steel), which was in Greek called \Ikuanos\i (cyan) and was dark-blue in colour (on the etymology of this word and the related Hitt. \Ikuwanna-\i see under \I*kwwV\i). We must also mention the widespread Caucasian myth about the birth of the cultural hero from a blue stone - which metaphorically depicts the ritual of tempering iron (see in greater detail Ardzinba 1985).     In view of all this the theory of Yakovlev (1941, 140-141), Shagirov (1,  140-141) who tried to explain PAK \I*ʁʷəə\i as "dried (\Iʁʷə-\i) earth (\Iə\i)" must be obviously taken as a folk etymology. Far more right was Abdokov (1973, 48) who thought the AK and Ubykh words genetically related and explained \I*ʁʷə-\i as "metal" and \I*-ə\i as a colour-name. He proposed to consider the second part as "grey", not specifying, however, what particular root he had in mind (thus invoking Shagirov's criticism). Shagirov is right, indeed, that PAK \I*əxʷə\i 'light-blue, pale' (Ad. \Iəfə,\i Kab. \Isəxʷ\i) can not be involved (it has , not ). For Ubykh Abdokov probably meant the root present in Ub. \Icʷa-ba\i 'greyish' - which is actually possible (note a quite analogous variation ʷ / cʷ in the Ub. reflexes of PWC \I*ʷV\i 'earth' q.v.).     There is more to be said about the hypothetical PWC \I*ʁIʷəʷV\i 'iron'. Since several authors relate the Hatti language to WC (see, e.g., Ivanov 1985), it seems very tempting to relate \I*ʁIʷəʷV\i to the attested Hatti name for 'iron', \Iʯap/walki\i (with ʯVw- rendering *ʁIʷ- and -lk- rendering the lateral --), borrowed in Hurrian as \Iʯabalgi,\i and further - Greek \Ikhalko-s,\i Balto-Slav. \I*geleg-\i etc. (see Starostin 1985)."
