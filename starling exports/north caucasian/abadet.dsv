PAT \I*qʷa,\i PAK \I*tχʷa/*tχʷǝ.\i The cluster *tq:ʷ- may in fact have been *rq:ʷ- or *lq:ʷ- (since the number of clusters in PWC is restricted), which would be a better match for the EC forms.
4|*jaɣˊa|364|ashes|||jāžˊa|jāzˊa||    PAK \I*jažˊaˊ.\i The word has no PAT or Ub. parallels, but reliable correspondences in PEC - thus the inner PAK etymology proposed in Шагиров 1, 169 (ja- - same as in \I*jaṭa\i 'clay, dirt', -žˊa - related to PAK \I*žˊǝ\i 'wind, air') seems less convincing.

6|*mǝgʷA / *mǝḳʷA|684|belly|aˊ-mgʷa|mgʷa|||nǝḳʷǝˊ|    PAT \I*mǝgʷa;\i Ub. def. \Ia-nǝˊḳʷ.\i A complicated case of correspondences between AA and Ub.: we must assume a secondary deglottalisation in PAT (for reasons which are not yet clear) and a dissimilative change *m- > n- before a labiovelar in Ub. (we should note that roots of the type mVKʷV are indeed very rare in Ub.). Comparison of Ub. \Inǝḳʷǝˊ\i with PAK \I*ḳʷaˊc̣ǝ\i 'intestines' (Шагиров 1, 217) is not persuasive.

9|*čʷǝχʷa|5|1 big 2 strong|||-šxʷa 1|-šxʷa 1|šχʷa 2|    Seems to be less used in modern Kab. (in Ad. this is the main word for 'big'). PAK \I*čxʷa.\i The AK-Ub. comparison belongs to Dumeˊzil (1932, 95). Klimov (1969, 290) has compared the AK root with Abkh. \Ia-mcχʷ\i 'surplus'; this comparison is, however, justly rejected by Shagirov (2, 61-62) (both for phonetic and semantic reasons).         The precise nature of the initial PWC affricate here is hard to determine, since both in PAK and Ub. the initial clusters of the type 'affricate+fricative' are substantially restricted (in Ub. all affricates change to fricatives in this position; in PAK palatalized/non-palatalized affricates are neutralised before fricatives). Position within a cluster also explains the change of uvular to velar in PAK (no combinations of front affricates + uvular fricatives are allowed).
10|*jǝnǝ|687|big|||jǝnǝ|jǝn||    PAK *jǝnǝˊ. Etymology obscure (relationship to Ub. wa 'long', proposed in Шагиров 1,185 is dubious - since the only two secure cases of n:w correspondence between PAK and Ub. occur after labialised consonants, which is not the case in the present root).

PAK \I*bzǝ-wǝˊ\i (where -wǝ is an archaic diminutive suffix).     Reconstruction of PAT *sˊ (and, therefore, PWC *š) is based on Abkh. Bzyb. evidence quoted in Marr's dictionary; since Bghazhba has not included the word in his book, it may well be Marr's misspelling - in that case we must reconstruct simply PAT \I*pǝsǝ-ʕa-\i and PWC \I*bǝsA.\i

Bz. \I-c-ħa-,\i Ub. 1st p. \Isǝˊ-q̇Iǝ-n.\i In PAT and PAK present is a compound with 'tooth' as a first component: PAT \I*cǝ-ħa-,\i PAK \I*c:a-q:a-.\i     PAT *ħ reflects rather PWC *q̇Iˊ (with palatalization due to Ablaut?); the normal reflex q̇ is present in the reduplicated form PAT \I*q̇aq̇A\i (Abkh. \Iaˊ-q̇aq̇a-ra,\i Abaz. \Iq̇aq̇-ra\i) = Ub. \Iq̇Iaq̇Iǝ-\i 'to chew'.
15|*c̣ʷa|690|black|aˊ-jkʷa-č̣̌a|kʷa-jč̣ʷa|s.ˊ̌ǝ-c̣a|f̣ǝ-c̣a|ǯˊa|    The PAT form is a compound \I*jǝkʷa-c̣ʷa\i (for the first part cf. Abkh. \Ia-jkʷaˊ\i dark'). \I-c̣ʷa\i can not be treated here as the same root as PAT \I*jac̣ʷa\i 'blue, green' (q.v.) for accentological reasons: \Ia-jkʷaˊ(j)č̣a\i would be expected in Abkh.).         The PAK word \I*c̣ʷǝc̣a\i 'black' goes back (as proposed by Шагиров 2, 103) to \I*c̣ʷǝ\i 'black' + \I*ṗc̣a-\i 'thick, dense' with secondary elision of -ṗ-; the root \I*c̣ʷA\i 'black' is used also in a number of other compounds.         Since exactly the same correspondence is present in the word for 'fire' (q.v.) one can not separate the Ub. form from the rest, but problems remain: we have to account for deglottalisation and delabialisation of the root consonant. We can, however, suppose that the original form is still preserved in the word for 'coal': Ub. \Igˊaˊ(n)-c̣ʷa,\i cf. PAK \I*c̣ʷa-mǝč̣ˊǝ\i id.

Ub. \Ipqǝ\i (\Iaˊ-pq\i) 'bone' is considered (see Шагиров 2,48) an Adygh loan (as also Abaz. \Iṗq̇ǝ\i 'carcass, skeleton'), which must be true (otherwise we should expect pharyngealised -qI(ʷ)- in Ub.).

PAK \I*sǝ\i / \I*stǝ.\i The AK intransitive verb is rarely used; more frequent is the derivate Ad. \Iʁa-stǝ-n,\i Kab. \Iʁa-sǝ-n\i 'to burn'. Origins of Ad. -t- are not very clear (perhaps a contamination with \Ipšˊta-\i 'to boil' - cf. Kab. \Ipsˊtǝ-r\i 'hot' /derived from \Ipsˊtǝ-n\i 'boil'/ along with \Isǝr\i 'burning, scorching' = Ad. \Istǝ-r\i 'hot; burning, scorching').
23|*mǝλǝ|18|nail, claw|-ṗχǝ-c|-ṗχǝ/-mχǝ||||    For PAT two compounds may be reconstructed: a) \I*naṗǝ-mǝxǝ\i 'fingernail' (\I*naṗǝ\i 'hand'), whence Abaz. \Inaṗχǝ,\i Abkh. \Ia-naṗχǝˊ-c,\i Bz. \Ia-naṗxǝˊ-cˊ/a-napxǝˊ-sˊ\i (with an additional suffixed -cˊ); b) \I*šˊaṗǝ-mǝxǝ\i 'toenail' \I(*šˊaṗǝ\i 'foot'), whence Abaz. \Išˊamχǝ,\i Abkh. \Ia-šˊaṗχǝˊ-c,\i Bz. \Ia-šˊaṗxǝˊ-cˊ/a-šˊapxǝˊ-sˊ/a-šˊamxǝˊ-sˊ.\i     Initial *m- is clearly visible in the second compound, while in the first it had been lost completely because of dissimilation with the initial n-.     PAT *x goes back to several PWC consonants (*ƛ̣,*ƛ,*λ(*λ:),*x); *-λ- is  chosen here because of EC counterparts. Abdokov (1983, 77) compares the AA form with PAK \I*(p)χʷaˊ-mba\i 'finger' which is semantically dubious and phonetically impossible.      
24|*bǝ˜zˊʷa|695|1 horn 2 hoof 3 nail, claw||šˊa-mza 2|bzˊa 1|bzˊa 1|-žʷa 3|    PAK \I*bzˊa\i (nowadays used mainly in the meaning 'horn for drinking'; 'horn of animals' is rendered by a compound \I*bzˊa-q:ʷa\i q.v.). It is also used in compounds \I*λaˊ-bzˊa\i 'hoof' > Ad. \Iλābzˊ,\i Kab. \Iλābzˊa\i (\I*λa\i 'foot') = Abaz. \Išˊa-mza\i (but despite Шагиров 1, 89 this root has nothing to do with Abaz. \Imsa,\i Abkh. \Ia-msa\i 'horn matter' q.v.) and \I*ʡa-bzˊaˊ-na\i 'fingernail', \I*λa-bzˊaˊ-na\i 'toenail' > Ad. \Iʡabzˊān,\i \Iλabzˊān,\i Kab. \Iʡabzˊāna,\i \Iλabzˊāna\i (\I*ʡa\i 'hand, \I*λa\i 'foot', \I*na\i 'eye' - see Шагиров 1, 249; 2, 156).     Despite Abdokov (1983, 106-107) PAK \I*λaˊ-bzˊa\i with the meaning 'root' is  hard to separate from the homonymous \I*λaˊ-bzˊa\i 'hoof'. That is why Abaz.  \Išˊajʒa\i 'root' (having no Abkhaz counterpart) should rather be regarded as an  old Adygh loanword (although -j- instead of -b- is rather hard to explain).     Ub. \I-žʷa\i (probably with a late dissimilative loss of initial labial) is present in compounds \Iq̇a(n)cʷa-žʷaˊ \i 'fingernail' (\Iq̇ancʷa\i 'finger') and \Išˊa(n)cʷa-žʷaˊ \i'toenail' (\Išˊa(n)cʷa\i 'toe'). Abdokov (1983, 82) cites Ub. \Ibžˊa\i  'horn' which is probably non-existant (while Abkh. \Ia-msa\i 'horn', also cited  ibid., goes back to PWC \I*pǝ˜ša\i q.v.).
25|*pǝsǝtA (?)|696|cloud|a-pstħʷa|pstħwa||||    In Abkh. there coexist variants aˊ-pta and aˊ-pstħʷa (bz. aˊ-pstħʷa). The variant aˊ-pta may be explained by a secondary elision of -s- to avoid contamination with a-psta 'ravine' (see Шагиров 2, 28); we may also accept Shagirov's explanation (ibid.) of -ħʷa as an unvoiced variant of *ʕʷa 'smoke' (q.v.). We are thus left with the PAT root *pǝsǝtA 'cloud' whose further etymology is unclear.     Shagirov's attempt (ibid.) to explain *pǝsǝtA from *pǝsǝ 'water, liquid' + *tA 'to give' must be rejected on accent grounds: the root *pǝsA 'to wet, liquid' (q.v.) belongs to the dominant accent class in PAT and we should expect the accentuation *a-psǝˊta (*a-psaˊta) in Abkh. Abdokov's (1973, 27, 64) comparison with PAK *pčˊa 'cloud', *pčˊaˊʁʷa 'fog' must be rejected on phonetic grounds.
26|*pǝƛa|78|cloud|||pšˊa|pša||    PAK \I*pčˊa.\i Shagirov's etymology (2,28) from \I*psǝ-čˊa\i 'bringing water' is not enough grounded phonetically. Since PAK *čˊ regularly goes back to PAT *ƛ we prefer to compare the AK root directly with the EC material.
27|*šʷawǝda ?|697|cloud|||||šawǝdaˊ|    An isolated Ub. word with obscure etymology.

(with an unclear second component), \I*ʒǝ-χˊǝ\i 'cold water, spring' (Abkh. \Ia-ʒǝˊχˊ,\i Abaz. \Iʒǝχˊ\i).     PAK \I*šˊǝtǝ-\i = PAT \I*xˊǝ-ta.\i Abdokov (1983, 104) attempts to relate the PAT root (separated from PAK)  to Arch. \IχIe-\i 'cold'; this is obviously impossible (the Archi form, along  with a number of other EC reflexes, goes back to PEC and PNC \I*=HĭGĀ\i q.v.).
29|*č̣ˊʷǝ (/*čˊʷǝ)|331|cold|||čǝʡa|ṣˊǝʡa|čˊǝ|    PAK \I*č̣ǝ-ʡaˊ\i (in Ad. a secondary dissimilative deglottalisation). It is harder to account for deglottalisation in Ub.; in any case, the PAK and Ub. forms are obviously related. Cf. also Ub. impers. \Ia-čˊǝˊ\i 'it is cold'.     Despite Shagirov (2, 154) PAK \I*č̣ˊǝ\i 'winter' .and. \I*ṗǝč̣ˊa-\i 'to freeze' should be strictly kept apart from this root (they have a different root consonant); PAT \I*c̣ǝʕa\i / \I*c̣ǝħa\i 'ice' also should be separated (the PAT *c̣ : PAK *č̣ correspondence does not exist).
30|*jǝ|161|come|a-neˊ-jra|ʕa-jra||||    PAT \I*jǝ,\i used only with locative preverbs (\I*na-jǝ-\i 'come there', \I*ʕa-jǝ-\i 'come here'). There are no known parallels in other WC languages, but there exist possible EC correspondences.
31|*ḳˊʷa|405|go, walk|||ḳʷa-|ḳʷa-|ḳˊa-|    PAK \I*ḳʷa.\i With preverbs the same root is used in AK and Ub. for the meaning 'to come'. Shagirov (1, 216) compares also PAT \I*nǝ-q̇ʷa-\i 'walk, move', which is impossible phonetically.

PAK \I*psˊǝ-.\i In Ub. - a compound whose second component (-χʷǝ-) is not quite clear.

34|*dV|701|1 grow numb 2 die 3 dead body||qʷa-di 3|dǝ-jǝ-n 1|di-ji-n 1|dǝ-waˊ- 2|    In AT the root has survived only within the Abaz. compound \Iqʷa-di\i ( < \I*qʷa-dǝ-jǝ;\i for the first part see PWC \I*qˊIʷa\i 'dead body').     The AK languages have preserved the root within three compounds: PAK \I*dǝ-jǝ-\i 'grow numb', \I*dǝ-q:ǝ-\i id. (Ad., Kab. \Idǝq:ǝ-n\i) and \I*ħa-daˊ\i 'dead body'  ( = Abaz. \Iqʷa-di\i id.) > Ad. \Iħāda,\i Kab. \Iħada.\i Both AK verbs have been borrowed by Abaz. (Abaz. \Idǝj-ra,\i \Idǝq̇-ra\i). There are absolutely no reasons to suppose that the PAK \I*ħadaˊ\i had been borrowed from Ub. \Iaˊ-dǝja\i 'dead body' (despite Шагиров 2, 116-117).     Ubykh preserves the root in the reduplicated form (\Idǝdǝˊ-\i 'grow numb') and in a number of derivates: \Idǝ-waˊ-\i 'to die', \Idǝ-waˊ\i 'death'; \Idǝ-jaˊ\i (def. \Iaˊ-dǝja\i) 'dead body', \Iwaˊ-dǝja-\i 'to perish'. On the possible etymology of the component wa see under \I*qˊIʷa.\i

This is probably due to the influence of \I*psǝ\i 'water' (very frequent in combination with the verb 'to drink').     The original meaning of the root - as it is clearly seen on external evidence - was 'to milk, (to drink milk)'. Derivates from this root mean 'milch cow, cow' in many EC languages. Hence it is natural to relate to this root also PWC \I*zʷǝ\i / \I*mǝ-zʷǝ\i 'cow' (with *mǝ- as a probable deverbative prefix): PAT \I*zʷǝ\i (Abkh. \Iaˊ-ž̌,\i Bzyb. \Iaˊ-zˊ̌,\i Abaz. \Ižʷǝ\i) 'cow', Ub. \Imǝzʷ-ʁǝˊ\i 'heifer'.

37|*ŁA- / *lˊA-|425|ear|a-lǝˊmħa|lǝmħa|tħāḳʷǝm|tħaḳʷǝma|Laḳʷǝma|    There are two PWC roots, which are probably later differentiated variants of one original root for 'ear':     a) \I*ŁA-\i in compounds meaning 'ear': PAT \I*lǝ-mǝħa\i (where -ħa must be the same root as PAT \I*ħa\i 'to hear' q.v.; see Ломтатидзе 1955, 824); PAK \I*tħaˊ-ḳʷǝma\i and Ub. \ILaˊ-ḳʷǝma\i (etymology of the second component obscure);     b) \I*lˊA-\i in compounds meaning 'to listen': PAT \I*-ʒˊǝ-rǝ-ʕʷǝ-\i (Abkh. \Iaˊ-ʒrǝʕʷ-ra,\i Bz. \Iaˊ-ʒˊʕʷǝr-ra\i /with metathesis/, Abaz. \Iʒǝrʕʷ-ra\i); PAK \I*da-ʡʷa-\i (Ad., Kab. \Idaʡʷa-n\i); Ub. \ILa-q̇ʷǝˊ-.\i Here Shagirov (1, 150) thinks that PAT *ʒˊ corresponds to PAK *d - this is certainly wrong, because in this case (PWC *bˊʷ) we should expect dʷ, and not L in Ubykh. PAT \I*ʒˊǝ-\i in this verb is probably a modification of the reciprocal version prefix *-zˊǝ- (which is semantically rather plausible). The element corresponding to PAK *d and Ub. L here must be PAT *r (*-rǝʕʷǝ-) which (despite Shagirov ibid.), of course, can not be considered a causative prefix (the verb has no causative semantics at all). For the second part of this PWC compound see \I*q:ˊIʷǝ-.\i The root \I*da-\i ( < \I*lˊa-\i) is present in another PAK compound \I*da-gʷǝˊ\i 'deaf' (where -gʷǝ is a privative suffix: "earless"), see Шагиров 1, 145. Judging from the external evidence, the variant with the resonant \I*lˊA\i is original; reasons for its transformation into a lateral affricate in the word for "ear" are yet to be investigated.
38|*ƛ̣ʷA|514|earth|||č̣ǝ|ṣˊǝ|jǝ-cʷaˊ|    PAK *č̣ǝ. Its regular Ub. correspondence is present in Ub. jǝ-c̣ʷaˊ- 'on the earth' (preverb); reasons for deglottalisation of -c̣ʷ- in the Ub. noun (which is certainly representing the same root) are not yet clear.      This root is to be strictly kept apart from PAK *č̣a 'bottom' which has quite different external parallels.

We have to reconstruct initial *p: to account for the AK progressive assimilation (\I*p:c:a\i < \I*p:sa\i); both in PAT and Ub. the assimilation had been regressive. Numerous attempts to analise the word on WC ground and to explain it as an IE loan (see Shagirov 1, 82 with literature) seem to us unsuccessful.

The root \I*bza-\i can also be seen in the compound verb \I*č:a-bza-\i 'to get pure, settle (of water)'.         The Ub. form with glottalisation suggests PWC *ṗ-; the PAT reflex *-z- confirms it (if in PWC we had \I*bǝc̣ˊA,\i then even after assimilation PAT *-zˊ- would be expected; on the other hand, *-zˊ- normally yields PAT *-z-). However, earlier glottalisation must have resided on the affricate, since the initial labial certainly is a historical prefix and there were no glottalised labial prefixes in NC or WC.

One may suppose that it didn't occur in old compounds like \I*sˊħa-cǝ\i 'hair of head' (medial -c- did not undergo spirantization) which hindered spirantization in the independent position.     Abdokov (1983, 83-84) compares PWC \I*cǝ\i 'hair', explained as a contraction <  \I*dǝsǝ,\i with PAK \I*lasˊa,\i Ub. \Idašʷa\i 'wool' (see under \I*lasˊʷV\i). If this is true  we should rather speak of a more complicated contraction \I*lasˊʷǝ\i > \I*tħVsˊǝ\i  [which would be a regular reflex] > \I*cˊǝ\i > \I*cǝ.\i In this case, \I*-cǝ\i in PAT \I*qʷǝ-cǝ\i '(a single) hair' should be kept apart from the PAK form.

In AK this root has survived only within the compound \I*λa-gʷa(n)ža-mǝ-sˊħa\i 'kneeling' (\I*λa-gʷa(n)ža\i is the PAK word for 'knee').  Thus Abdokov's (1983, 79) comparison of PAT \I*mǝ-qA\i with an isolated Akhvakh  form (Akhv. \Imuq̇u\i 'knee') should be rejected.

In Ub. cf.  also \Iṗc̣ˊaˊ-wa\i 'leaf', \Iṗc̣ˊāˊ-d(ǝ\i)ʁa 'paper'. The correspondence PAK *č̣ˊ: Ub. c̣ˊ points unambiguously to PWC *ƛ̣.

In AK (PAK \I*λǝ-\i) and Ub. this root is used only with locative preverbs (cf. Kab. \Ijǝ-λǝ-n\i 'lie within', Ub. \Ibʁˊa-λǝ-\i 'lie upon'  etc.). In Ub. the root is confined to the plural (being the collective counterpart of -sǝ- q.v.).     The transitive meaning ("to put") is not attested in the verbal paradigm, but there are some nominal derivates which have preserved it: cf. Kab. \Iλa\i 'place' (*'place to put smth.'), Ub. \Iλa-šʷaˊ\i 'sheath, case' ("place (-šʷa) to put smth. in").

(Shagirov 2,83 proposes 'spirit' (*tħa) + 'accompany', Kab. ṣˊǝʁʷǝ-n - but the latter corresponds to Ad. č̣ˊǝʁʷǝ-n < *č̣ǝʁʷǝ-). Despite  Abdokov 1982, 83, the AK form should certainly be kept distinct from WC *c̣ʷA  'liver' q.v.

The second component, \I*ħA,\i is strangely enough, related by Shagirov (ibid.) to PAK \I*ħA\i 'bring, carry'. We would still like to follow Trubetzkoy in connecting the AK and Ub. forms (the ħ:w correspondence is here just the same as in the word for "dog"). However, PAT should have regularly had l-, not w- here; perhaps we should assume that PWC *Łʷ was for some reason split into l and w in PAT (position before different vowels? - there are too few examples to come to a definite conclusion).         In Ub. wa can be also discovered in the word for far (\Iλa-waˊ\i lit. 'long for feet').

Ub. has a compound of \I*ṭa\i 'nit' + \I*c̣ˊA\i 'louse' (despite Shagirov 2, 125 Ub. \Iṭaḳˊ\i 'louse' can not belong here; coincidence with -c̣ˊ in \Idǝmac̣ˊ\i 'egg' is probably fortuitous).
95|*ṭa|727|1 louse 2 nit|||||ṭaḳˊ 1, ṭac̣ˊ 2|    The Ub. root \Iṭa-\i is isolated (\Iṭa-ḳˊ\i may be an old singulative form; about -c̣ˊ see \I*c̣ˊA\i - Ub. \Iṭa-,\i inspite Shagirov 2, 125, can have nothing to do with this root), but has rather probable EC parallels.

AT languages have kept the root only in compounds \I*macʷǝqA-bA\i 'thumb' (Abkh. \Ia-načχǝˊ-b,\i Abaz. \Imačʷqa-ba\i) and \I*šˊacʷǝqA-bA\i 'big toe' (Abkh. \Ia-šˊačχǝˊ-b,\i Abaz. \Išˊačʷqa-ba\i) = Ub. \Iq̇a(n\i)cʷa-bIǝ, \Iλa(n\i)cʷa-bIǝ.       Another common WC compound with the same component is \I*λˊa-bIA\i "foot's bulge" > Ad. \Iλa-b\i 'heel', Ub. \Iλa-bIǝ\i (in compounds) - see Dumeˊzil 1965, 235, Шагиров 1, 248-249).         On the etymology of PAK \I*ba\i see Шагиров 1,70-71 with literature (all attempts to separate this morpheme from Ub. \IbIǝ\i and AA \I*-bǝ\i seem to us superfluous).

The meaning 'meat' in Abkh. is obviously secondary (\Ia-žˊǝ\i q.v. was the original name for meat).     Different attempts to analise the AK stem as a compound (see Shagirov 1, 217 with literature) seem rather arbitrary. It is probably best to regard the root as a whole.

Despite Shagirov (ibid.) and Gan 1909, 68 the first component \Iq:ʷǝ-\i should be kept apart from PAK \I*q:ʷa\i 'gorge, ravine, valley' - the latter has a separate Ub. parallel, see \I*q:ʷa.\i

In the Abzh. dialect and in Abaz. the word was transformed to \Ič̣ǝc\i under influence of another root, \I*č̣a\i q.v. The pure root \I*c̣ˊǝ\i is preserved in Abkh. \Ia-j-c̣-raˊ\i (Bz. \Ia-j-c̣ˊ-raˊ\i) 'to be younger, smaller', \Ia-j-c̣-baˊ\i (Bz. \Ia-j-c̣ˊ-baˊ,\i Abaz. \Iajc̣ba\i) 'junior'.          The AK languages preserve this root only within the compound \I*c̣ǝ-ḳʷǝˊ\i 'small, young, youngster' (\Ic̣ǝ-\i regularly < \I*c̣ˊǝ-;\i the precise meaning of the second component is not quite clear yet).

Despite Shagirov (2, 27) the component \Isˊħa\i here means 'evening' by itself and has nothing to do with PAK  \I*sˊħa\i 'head'.     The correspondence PAK \I*sˊħa\i = Ub. \Išʷǝwaˊ\i is exact and points unambiguously to PWC \I*sˊʷǝ-Łʷa.\i This stem itself is probably an old compound, with probable external parallels for both parts).

The PAT form \I*pǝnǝc̣ˊa\i can not be kept apart from Osset. \Ifɨnʒ\i 'nose' (see Abayev 1958, 497); since the PAT form has a clear morphological structure, we must acknowledge that it is also the ultimate source of Georg. \Iṗinčwi\i and Arm. \Ipinǯ\i 'nostril'.
122|*mǝ|2272|not (negative particle)|m-|-m-|mǝ-|mǝ-|-m(a)-|    Used in AA and Ub. as both negative and prohibitive particle; in the AK languages it is a common prohibitive morpheme and is also used in deverbatives (e.g., in infinitives etc.); as a general negative morpheme it was absolutely lost in Ad., and in Kabardian stayed only within the complex negative suffix \I-q:ǝ-m.\i

Ubykh has šˊ instead of the expected čˊ since combinations of affricates + fricatives are forbidden; for a possible etymology of \Itʷa-\i see under \I*tʷa\i 'liquid'. Comparison of the AK and Ubykh forms see in Abdokov 1973, 70; AK and Abkh. - in Klimov 1967, 304.         The semantic shift 'urinate' > 'rain' is quite acceptable (cf. russ. мочить - мочиться etc.); therefore Shagirov's (2, 228) criticism of Klimov's etymology is hardly justified.

Ubykh has two words for 'round' (see Vogt 210): \Iχʷǝrǝˊ-b\i and \Iχʷǝraˊj\i - the latter is obviously an AK loanword, but the former may be genetically related to the AK form.

It was borrowed into Abaz. in the form pχačaqʷa - however, Shagirov is probably right in thinking that the AK word had been reinterpreted in Abaz. as pχača 'coarse-grained' (also an AK loan) + qʷa 'ashes'. Circassian pχa(r)šāχʷa 'sand' is in this case a back-loan from Abaz. Ubykh pšāχʷa 'sand' is also most probably a recent Ad. loanword.     Further etymology of PAK *pčaχʷaˊ is not clear.

See Shagirov 1977, 199 for the comparison of PAK and Ub. He reconstructs for PAK the meaning "back part"; however, it must be secondary, cf. the older meaning 'middle, half' in PAT and Ub. \Iza(n)-ǯˊaˊ\i 'middle, half' (\Iza-\i "one"?). The correspondence between PAK *ʒˊ (Ad. ǯˊ, Kab. zˊ), PAT *ž and Ub. ǯˊ points to a rare PWC phoneme *ʒˊʷ.

Despite Rogava and Shagirov (see Shagirov 2, 125) can not be related to PAK \I*c̣ǝḳʷǝ\i 'small' (PAT *č̣ˊ never corresponds to PAK *c̣).
152|*(a)gʷǝ|384|small|||||agʷǝˊ|    In Ub. two roots are usually confused: (a)gʷǝˊ 'small' and gʷǝ- 'to grind' (q.v.); see Vogt 129 about this distinction. The root 'small' seems to have no correlates in WC languages, but has possible parallels in EC.

PAK \I*ta-gˊǝ-\i (the meaning of the first component is not quite clear - see Шагиров 2, 69 on its possible etymology).     In Ub. the preverb \Igˊǝ-\i is used to indicate that the action is taking place on surface of smth. (\Igˊǝ-s-\i 'sit upon smth.', \Igˊǝ-tʷ-\i 'be upon smth.' etc.). There are reasons to think that the root \I*gǝ\i had had this function already in PWC (cf. the common WC compound \I*gA-LA-\i 'to fall (from above, from the surface) q.v.).

PAK \I*tǝ-\i (usually with preverbs) 'be, stay, stand'; also used as a preverb "upon the surface of smth.".     In Ub. the root \I-t(ǝ)-\i is used as a variant of \Itʷǝ-\i 'to be' in some forms (see Vogt 16, 194); historically these are two quite different roots (see PWC \I*pˊǝ-\i).
156|*pˊǝ|763|be|-ṗ|-ṗ|||-tʷ(ǝ)-|    PAT \I*-ṗǝ\i is used as a common suffixed root denoting present tense of static verbs and future tense of dynamic verbs. Glottalisation is here probably secondary - because of standard reduction of final -ǝ and neutralisation of laryngeal features in final position.     Ub. \I-tʷ(ǝ)-\i is a general verbal root ('to be, to be there') used with all kinds of preverbs.     In AK we would expect *-t- to correspond to Ub. tʷ; it seems probable that the two general PWC verbal roots, \I*tV\i and \I*pˊǝ,\i merged in PAK \I*tǝ-\i (see \I*tV\i).

Vogt lists also the variant \Ijacʷa\i (with secondary loss of glottalisation). In PAK the roots 'star' and 'sky' (\I*zʷA\i q.v.) had "changed places": \I*-sʷa\i (going back to \I*cʷa\i with loss of glottalization like in Ub.) meant originally 'star', but lost this meaning in the compound \I*wa-sʷaˊ\i (where \I*wa-\i means 'sky' by itself, see \I*wa\i).

Abdokov  (1983, 93) compares the AT and AK forms with PAK \I*žˊǝ\i 'wind, air', which is  improbable for phonetic reasons (see PWC \I*ɣˊǝ\i).

The relationship of PAK \I*t:ǝʁaˊ\i 'sun' and \I*t:ǝʁʷaˊ-sa\i 'yesterday' (Ad.  \Itǝʁʷās,\i Kab. \Idǝʁʷāsa\i) may be considered, but still remains questionable (see  the discussion in Shagirov 1, 154, Abdokov 1983, 100-101).

Abkh. \Ia-naˊ\i 'there', \Ia-ni\i (\I*a-nǝ-jǝ\i) 'that' etc.; also used as a preverb \Ina-\i 'there' (directive). It is possible that the 3d person pronominal prefix \In(a)-\i (in some verbal forms) in Abkh. and Abaz. also goes back to the same root.     In AK the stem has survived only as a preverb \I*na-\i (Ad., Kab. \Ina-\i) with exactly the same functions as in AA.     Finally, in Ubykh the only traces of this morpheme are the pronominal prefixes of the 3d person \In-\i (sing.), \Inā-\i (plur.), obviously related to the corresponding AA prefix \I*n(a)-\i.

171|*da|2304|a demonstrative stem|-da|-da|-da|-da|(aj)-da|    Dumeˊzil (1932, 120) relates Ub. -da in \Iaj-da\i 'that, another' (cf. also -da- in \Imā-da-ḳˊa\i 'where') to Abkh. -da in \Iaˊ-la-da\i 'down', \Iaˊ-ʕʷa-da\i 'above' ( < PAT \I*-da,\i cf. Abaz. \Iʕʷa-da\i 'ascent, climbing'). While this may be true, we would also adduce the AT pronominal (agentive) prefixes of the 3d person singular and plural (\I*dǝ-\i > Abkh., Abaz. \Id(ǝ)-\i) and probably also the 3d person plural pronoun \I*da-ra\i 'they' (Abkh. \Ida-raˊ,\i Abaz. \Ida-ra\i).     In AK the stem is preserved in \I*a-daˊ\i  'there' (Ad., Kab. \Iāda\i); cf. also Ad. \Itǝ-da\i 'where' and the PAK locative preverb \I*da-\i (Ad., Kab. \Ida-\i). See Шагиров 1, 57.

In AK the root functions as the 3d p. possessive prefix (\Ijǝ-\i 'his'), see Шагиров 1, 180.     In Ubykh \Ijǝ-\i is the demonstrative pronoun expressing near deixis ('this'); the same morpheme is probably used as a personal prefix of the 3d p. pl.

In this case it does not belong here. Cf., however, Kab. \Ipsˊtǝ-r\i 'hot' and AK \I*pšˊa-\i 'to cook' which could also serve as basis for \I*pšˊ(ǝ)-tA-\i.

It is probable that Ub. \Išˊa-\i 'be hot' goes back to another PWC root, \I*šˊV\i (\I*š:ˊV\i) which is not reflected in PAK, but in PAT merged with \I*šǝ\i < \I*λˊʷA.\i This seems probable because the Abkh. root means both 'boil' and 'become hot'.
186|*bzǝ|858|1 water 2 juice|a-ʒǝˊ 1,2|ʒǝ 1,2|psǝ 1|psǝ 1|bzǝ 1|    PAT \I*ʒǝ\i (cf. also Bz. \Ia-ʒǝˊ\i); PAK \I*psǝ;\i Ub. def. \Ia-bzǝˊ.\i Shagirov (2, 16) suggests that PAT \I*ʒǝ\i should be separated from the AK and Ub. forms and prefers to compare them with PAT \I*p(ǝ)sǝ\i '*water,*river' (reconstructed on hydronymic evidence). There exists indeed a PAT root \I*pǝsa\i 'to become wet, soak' (e.g. Abaz. \Ipsa-ra\i id., Abkh. (a-ʒǝˊ) \Ia-psaˊ-la-ra,\i Bz. (a-ʒǝˊ) \Ia-psǝˊ-la-ra\i 'throw into water') which could be compared with PAK \I*psǝ\i ( - but not with voiced bz- in Ub.!). Still it is very hard to separate the AA root \I*ʒǝ\i from Ubykh (with which it correlates even in what concerns accent), and the Ubykh one from AK. We think that in PAK there could have occurred a contamination of two original roots: \I*bzǝ\i 'water' and \I*pǝsǝ\i 'river; liquid' - this would be the best explanation of the whole situation.     Abdokov (1983, 185) compares PAT \I*ʒǝ\i with PAK \I*p:c:a-\i in \I*p:c:a-n-tħaˊ\i "glue" (Ad. \Ipcāntħa,\i Kab. \Ibʒāntħa\i). This would be fine in view of the EC data, but Shagirov (1, 81) is probably right in treating \I*p:c:a-n-tħaˊ\i as "fish glue" (with \I*p:c:a\i "fish").

190|*-a|2295|what, who (interrogative stem)|-a(-)|-a(-)||||    In Abkh. the meaning of interrogative pronouns is normally expressed by verbal suffixes -da ('who'), -j ('what'). Since d- and j- are class markers  (animate/unanimate respectively), the only morpheme to which we can ascribe the interrogative meaning is -a (probably reduced in *-ja > -j). The same morpheme can be seen in \I-a-ba-\i 'where' and independent pronouns \Id-a-rban\i 'who', \Ij-a-rban\i 'what' (the -rban suffix is not very clear etymologically - perhaps it contains the root \I*-ba-\i 'to see' q.v.?). In Abaz. the situation is analoguous - only in the function of independent pronouns we have \Id-zač̣ʷǝ-j-a\i 'who' and \Ij-zač̣ʷǝ-j-a\i (or \Iač̣ʷǝja\i) 'what'. These are derived (by suffixing the same hypothetic interrogative morpheme *-a) from \Id-zač̣ʷ,\i \Ij-zač̣ʷ\i 'each'  (\Iač̣ʷ\i probably had also existed) where \I-zač̣ʷ\i = Abkh. \I-zač̣ǝ\i 'single' (from \I*zA\i 'one').

In Kab. -t could have been obtained under influence of \Ixa-t\i 'who' (q.v.); thus we should probably reconstruct *-dA for PAK. The precise nature of this *-dA is not clear (perhaps it reflects the PWC demonstrative *da).

A similar root is used in WC with the meaning 'dawn, light': PAT \I*ša-\i 'to come (of dawn)' (Abkh. \Ia-ša-raˊ,\i Abaz. \Iša-ra\i), PAK \I*naˊ-xʷǝ\i 'light' (Ad. \Inaf,\i Kab. \Inaxʷ\i), Ub. \Isʷǝ\i 'dawn', \Ia-sʷǝˊ-n\i 'dawn is coming'.

Shagirov (1977) compares the AK form to PAT \I*ɣʷǝ\i 'board', Ub. \Iʁʷǝ\i 'post' (PWC \I*Gʷǝ\i), which seems much less trustworthy. The initial *b- of the PAK form is a historical prefix.

PAT *χˊ- can not in any way correspond to PAK *w-, and Ub. gˊ- to either, so we must assume that in all subgroups we have compounds with different initial components (but the nature of these components is not clear). The situation is aggravated by irregularity of correspondence between PAT *-t- , PAK *-t:- and Ub. -ṭ- and by the existence in Abaz. of a synonymous adjective \Iħat-la\i 'heavy' (does it have any connection with \I*χˊanǝta\i ?).

In spite of some semantic difficulties we think that it is possible to relate PAK \I*bLa-\i 'near, past' to the Ub. and PAT forms (a semantic shift of 'inside' to 'environs').

However, the phonetic explanation of the PAK form is more difficult (we should also expect \I*č̣ˊač̣ˊa\i). Shagirov (1977, 200) divides the AK form into the root *zˊa- and a diminutive suffix *-zˊǝjǝ; but we should rather think of a contraction and assimilation \I*č̣ˊač̣ˊa-zˊǝjǝ\i > \I*č̣ˊa-zˊǝjǝ\i > \I*zˊazˊǝjǝ.\i In any case, it is impossible to separate the PAK form from other WC forms.

However, the element q̇a- is the Ub. preverb \Iq̇a-\i 'in hand(s), at hand' (so \Iq̇a-ʒǝ-\i means something like 'near at hand') and does not correspond directly to PAT \I*ʕa-,\i PAK \I*q:a-.\i          See also under PWC \I*šǝ\i ( ~ *sˊ-) about possible AK parallels.

PAK \I*čˊǝ-ʁʷǝˊ\i (Shagirov 2, 142 must be right in equating the second component with \I*ʁʷǝ-\i 'dry, get dry').

In the AK word (\I*jǝ-λaˊ-sǝ\i) jǝ- is a pronominal prefix; meaning of the final component (-sǝ) is not quite clear (cf. *-sa in \I*paˊ-sa\i 'early'?). Shagirov's (1, 185) hypothesis of a Turk. origin seems, anyway, very improbable.     The original meaning of the root is not clear ('time' in general?).

However, external correspondences for the root as a whole make us suspect that this may be a folk etymology; in the latter case - since the correspondences are fully regular - the root could be reconstructed as such for PWC. Still, Ub. \Ižāḳˊa\i 'beard' is certainly borrowed from AK (otherwise we should expect žˊ- in Ub.).     From WC the word was borrowed into neighbouring languages, cf. Osset. (Dig.) \Izaḳä,\i \Izeḳä\i 'chin, beard', \IMegr.\i bžaḳe 'beard' (for initial b- cf. Abkh. Samurz. (Marr) \Ia-bžaˊḳˊa\i). See Abayev 1969, 285.

PAK \I*-Ła\i in a compound \I*c:a-Łaˊ\i 'rib(s)' (\I*c:a-\i 'tooth, sharp edge'). The correspondence PAK *Ł (Ad. ɣ, Kab. ž) :PAT *ǯʷ (Abkh. v, Abaz. ʒ) : Ub. ʒ points only to PWC *Łˊʷ.

The first part is normally reflected in Ub. \IbLa-\i and PAK \I*na-,\i but in PAT replaced by an obscure component \I*ǯˊǝ-\i (PAT \I*ǯˊǝ-mǝsV\i). In Abkh. a further assimilation has occurred (\I*ǯˊǝ-ms\i > \Iǯˊǝ-mšˊ\i). The strong *p:- in PWC is suggested by the PAK form \I*-p:c:a\i < \I*-p:sa\i (PAK \I*na-p:c:aˊ\i).

(bawa- 'to kiss' is quite a different root, despite Kuipers 14), thus *b- or *p:- may be reconstructed for PAK, and, consequently, for PWC. Despite Shagirov 1,77 the Kab. word is certainly not a Turkic loan, and the Ubykh word - not a loan from Kabardian.

It is possible, but seems to us less likely in view of the external evidence.         Since there are no AA parallels, it is impossible to distinguish between reconstructing *-š- or *-s- in the root.

Voiced bI- in Ub. is irregular (probably *pI- > *ṗI- (under influence of glottalisation) > *bI- (dissimilation)). The correspondence PAK *ʡ : Ub. q̇ points either to PWC *q̇ˊI or *qˊI:.

Shagirov (1977,251) derives \I*λapaˊdǝ\i from \I*λapa\i 'front part of the foot' + \I*da\i "to sew" which is quite improbable in view of the external evidence.

With labialisation cf. Shaps. \Ipχʷǝ-sˊʷṭa\i 'plum', \Ipχʷǝ-ca\i 'peach'. The PAK form \I*q:ǝ-ṗc̣aˊ\i 'plum' (Ad., Kab. \Iq:ǝṗc̣a\i) is probably a modification of \I*pχ(ʷ)ǝ-ṗc̣a\i under influence of PAK \I*q:ǝcaˊ\i 'peach' which has a separate etymology (q.v.).     In Ub. the root means 'a k. of big plum'.     The WC languages have yet another root with close meaning, but without the initial labial: cf. Abaz. \Iħʷa-saˊ,\i Abkh. \Ia-ħʷa-saˊ\i 'wild plum' (in Bzyb. we have \Ia-pħʷasˊaˊ\i / \Ia-bħʷasˊaˊ\i - obviously, a result of merging \I*pǝħʷa\i 'plum' and \I*ħʷasˊa\i 'wild plum'); *-sˊa is a frequent component in names of plants. We could compare also Bzhed. \Iχǝrc\i 'peach' (as opposed to other terms with *q:- or *pχʷ-, see above). Although we can not absolutely exclude the possibility of a secondary loss of the initial labial in these forms (see Shagirov 2, 229), it is still possible to reconstruct a separate PWC root \I*χ(ʷ)V\i (or \I*χˊ(ʷ)V\i, \I*χI(ʷ)V\i ) 'wild plum' opposed to \I*pǝqʷV\i plum. This root (but not Abkh. \Ia-pħʷaˊ,\i pace Lomtatidze 1961, 116-117) could be compared to PL \I*χʷen:\i 'plum, wild plum' (Lezg. \Iχʷat,\i dial. \Iχʷad,\i Tab. \Iχut,\i dial. \Iχud,\i Ag. \Iχut,\i dial. \Iχur,\i \Iχud,\i  Rut. \Iχäd,\i Tsakh. \Iχon,\i Kryz. \Iχed,\i Bud. \Iχed\i).

Again, pace Shagirov ibid., since the correspondence between Abkh. and Ad. here is quite obvious, it is impossible to connect the second part of the compound with PAK \I*bzǝ\i 'to cut' (q.v.). Finally, since Ub. has a palatal zˊ, the Ub. form (again despite Shagirov ibid.) can not be regarded as an Adygh loanword. The correspondence between PAK \I*-bʒa,\i PAT \I*pǝza\i and Ub. \I-bzˊa\i is quite regular.

Kumakhov's etymology (1964,126) - PAK \I*b(ǝ)q:aˊwǝ\i from \I*p:q:ǝ\i 'corpus, skeleton' - seems dubious, first of all because of the Kab. form \Ibǝq:ow\i (there's no parallel form \I*bǝq:ǝ\i 'skeleton' in Kab.). Very dubious is the comparison with Ub. \Ibǝq̇Iʷ\i 'thick' (Shagirov 2, 47).     Since there is no Ub. cognate, it is impossible to determine whether the first vowel in PWC was nasalized or not. Somewhat unclear is the status of the PAK *-wǝ: it is either a suffix (in this case \I*bǝq:aˊwǝ\i < \I*bǝq:ʷaˊ-wǝ\i), or part of the root which has yielded labialisation in Abkh. (\I*bVq̇ʷǝ\i < \I*bVq̇ǝwǝ\i).

The disappearance of *mV- in PAT must be explained by the fact that the root became verbal in PAT ('to eat') - and verbal roots can not begin with *m-.

Abkh. \Ia-bā\i 'rotten' has, of course, nothing to do with the root (pace Abdokov 1973,40).

The meaning of \I*xʷa\i may be reconstructed as "bone from one joint to another" < "joint" < "sinew". PAK \I*xʷa.\i     See Климов 1967.
287|*maλˊʷV|1047|good, luck|||māfa|māxʷa||    PAK \I*maxʷaˊ.\i The root is homonymous with \I*maxʷa\i 'day' - which is obviously a secondary merger. PAK *xʷ may go back to *λˊʷ, *λʷ, *xʷ or *xˊʷ; in this case *λˊʷ is preferable because of external evidence.

In Kab. we have a further compound with \I-ps(ǝ\i) 'water' (in Ad. there also exists a corresponding form \Iṗč̣ˊanṭa-ps\i).     The correspondence PAT *-x- (before affricate) : PAK *č̣ˊ is unambiguosly pointing to PWC *ƛ̣. Since there is no Ub. reflex, it is also possible to reconstruct nasalisation in PWC.     The etymology of the PAK form proposed by Shagirov (1977, 2, 53: "to weed" + "to dig") is absolutely unacceptable.

We should relate here also the Ub. reduplicated stem \Ic̣ʷac̣ʷ-\i (\Ic̣ʷac̣ʷǝˊ-n\i "cela fait mal", \Ic̣ʷac̣ʷǝˊ\i "mal, douleur"). For the semantic shift "dirty" > "bad" cf. PAK \I*ʡa-jV\i "bad" ( < \I*q̇ˊǝ-ja\i) where \I*ʡa\i = PAT \I*q̇ˊǝ\i 'dung' and Ub. \Iq̇ˊǝ-.\i     Shagirov's supposition that PAK \I*c̣ʷa-\i here = PAK \I*c̣ʷǝ\i "good" is unacceptable.

Unacceptable is Dumeˊzil's (Dumeˊzil 1963) etymology of the PAK form as "hand" + "bad". The PAK form is rather a compound analogous to Ub., and the component ʡa here has nothing to do either with PAK \I*ʡa-c̣ʷǝ\i "sweet" or with PAK \I*ʡa\i "hand". PAK *ʡ regularly goes back to PWC *q̇ˊ.

In Abkh. it was lost, and in Abaz. stayed only within a compound with \I(a)la-\i 'light' (same as in \Ila-šara\i 'light', historically = "eye").     In PAK the root \I*pcˊV\i ( < \I*P-ʒˊʷǝ\i with devoicing) is used in compounds \I*pcˊǝ-ħa\i 'evening' (listed above) and \I*pcˊa-dǝ-\i 'morning, tomorrow' (Kab. \Ipsˊa-dej\i 'tomorrow', \Ipsˊa-dǝ-ǯǝz\i 'morning', Ad. \Ipčˊa-dǝžˊ\i 'morning'). Finally, in Ub. the root -ǯˊ is also used only in compounds: \Izʷapsǝˊ-ǯˊ\i 'evening' (with \Izʷapsǝˊ\i id.) and \Isʷǝ-ǯˊ\i '(morning) dawn' (with \Isʷǝ\i id.).

Ub. \Iχʷǝ\i (compared with PAK \I*χʷǝ\i by Abdokov 1973, 73) may be an Ad. loan (which is the idea of T. Esenč, see Vogt 1963, 209, and of Shagirov 1977,2,112), but may well also be genuinely related (the phonetic correspondences are quite regular).
304|*č(ǝ)q̇a|1111|calf|||šḳa|šč̣a||    PAK \I*čḳa.\i Since there are no Ub. or PAT parallels (despite Balkarov 1964, 117 Ub. \ILaq̇ˊǝˊ\i 'calf' can not be compared), it is hard to guess the nature of the initial affricate in PWC (since in PAK there occurred neutralizations in clusters like *CK-). External evidence suggests that it must have been a hushing affricate. Also both velar *ḳ or uvular *q̇ may be reconstructed (since in clusters with dental affricates the Adygh languages do not tolerate uvulars).
305|*šˊʷa|532|1 son 2 youth, young boy|||sˊā-wa 2|sˊā-wa 1||    PAK *sˊa-waˊ. We can discover the same root (with the original meaning "to bear") in Ad. \Isˊā-λ(a)\i 'placenta', \Iχʷǝ-sˊa-n\i 'childbirth fits'. PAK *sˊ regularly goes back to PWC *šˊʷ.

Reflected are variants \I*gˊa(r)gˊa\i and \I*gʷa(r)gʷa\i which are hard to separate from each other.  Since there are no AK or Ub. parallels, we can assume both *gˊ (*gˊʷ) and *kˊ: (*kˊ:ʷ) in PWC.

The form \Ičˊǝgʷǝˊ\i corresponds best to Abkh. \Ia-gʷǝˊžˊ\i (if we assume a rather common metathesis). In PWC we must reconstruct *čˊ: and either *gʷ or *k:ʷ.

However, we think that the PAT form is also a descendant of the same root. Indeed, PAT "hissing-hushing" consonants may go back to PWC palatalized+labialized dentals, thus \I*cˊǝgʷǝ\i may go back to \I*tˊʷǝk:ʷǝ,\i and, if we assume a metathesis (which is very usual in roots of this type with two stops), we may postulate two basic variants for early PWC:     a) \I*kˊ:aṭˊǝwǝ\i > \I*kˊ:aṭǝwǝ\i ( > PAK \I*k:at:ǝˊwǝ,\i Ub. \Igˊaṭǝˊ\i);     b) \I*kˊ:atˊǝwǝ\i > \I*kˊ:ʷatˊʷǝ\i (with regressive labialisation) > PAT \I*gʷǝcˊǝ\i > \I*cˊǝgʷǝ.\i [Abdokov (1983, 123) compares the Abkh. form with heterogeneous diminutives: Chech. \Icic-ig,\i Av. \Iic:i-ko\i 'cat, kitty'. This is certainly wrong  because of the obviously different morphological structure of EC forms.]     It is interesting to note that these two forms exactly match two variants reconstructed for PEC (\I*gǟṭuj\i and \I*gǟtuj\i).

322|*t:aq:a|1143|cock|||ātāq:a|ādāq:a|taˊqa|    PAK \I*at:aq:aˊ.\i Ub. has t- instead of the expected d- under the influence of the Ad. form; a direct loan from Ad. is less probable.     Shagirov (1, 56) analyses the first part of the PAK form as \I*at:aˊ\i 'father', which is unacceptable because of external parallels and the obscure character of the component *-q:a (it is, however, possible that the prothesis *a- appeared in PAK under the influence of this root).
323|*mǝšˊʷV|1146|bear|aˊ-mš̌|mšʷǝ|mǝsˊa|mǝsˊa|mǝšʷaˊ|    PAT \I*mǝšʷǝ\i (cf. also Bzyb. \Iaˊ-mš̌\i); PAK \I*mǝsˊaˊ;\i Ub. def. \Iaˊ-mšʷa.\i

325|*šˊʷV|1149|1 red fox 2 jackal|aˊ-š̌a-bga (Bz)||baǯˊa-sˊ 2||bIagˊaˊ-šʷ 2|    The root is attested only within a compound with PWC \I*bIaga\i 'fox' (q.v.). Shagirov (1977, 72) supposed that the Ad. word was borrowed from Ubykh, which is hardly credible (we do not know of other loans in this direction). His reason was that the Ub. word can be analysed as \IbIaga\i 'fox' + \Išʷǝ\i 'diminutive suffix', but the external evidence (cf. especially Abkh. \Iaˊ-š̌a-bga\i) shows that this is a folk etymology, and šʷǝ here is an independent root.

The meaning 'hunting' in Ub. is secondary, being influenced by a similar (phonetically and semantically) root represented in Ub. \Isʷā-ḳˊaˊ\i 'hunter', PAK \I*š:a-ḳʷa-\i 'to hunt', PAT \I*šʷara-cˊa-\i 'to hunt' (the latter form demonstrates a similar merger of two originally distinct roots) < PWC \I*šˊ:ʷa-\i 'to hunt'. The components *-ħV in PAK and *-xǝ in PAT (\I*šʷara-xǝ\i) are unclear. They may represent originally independent roots (for PAK \I*ħV\i cf. PEC \I*wHɨ̆rχ̲V\i 'mountain goat', for PAT \I*-xǝ\i cf. PEC \I*ɦānxV\i 'deer' q.v.), but since they are attested only in compounds and in different subbranches of WC, such etymologies at present seem too risky.     The roots for 'deer' (\I*šˊʷV\i) and 'hunt' (\I*šˊ:ʷa\i) are correctly separated by Shagirov (1977,2,149) in an argument with Dumeˊzil (1967,160; 1969, 112). Also correct is his separating of Abkh. \Ia-čaˊ\i 'female deer' and Ub. \Ižʷa\i 'deer' (see PWC \I*čˊʷa\i / \I*ǯˊʷa\i). However, his separating PAT \I*šʷVrV\i from PAK \I*sˊǝħVˊ\i is hardly justified (the Ub. form \Iλa-šʷaˊ\i is not even considered).

Shagirov (1977, 103) proposes for the Adygh form a loan from Turk. (\Ibilim\i 'knowledge'), but it seems absolutely unacceptable for semantic reasons.

The Ub. form may reflect PWC *d-,*t:- or *r-; *-ʁʷ-,*-Gʷ- or *-ɣʷ-; the form \I*rǝɣʷǝ\i is thus only one of the possible variants of the PWC reconstruction, fitting best for the EC data.

If we take all the said into account, correspondences between the three branches will be quite regular (we have only to assume an assimilation \I*cˊaʒa\i > \Icˊaca\i in Ub.).     The correct comparison of all three branches see in Aбдоков 1973, 50. Shagirov's (1977, 168) attempt to derive the AK form from Turkic (Kirgh. \Isūsar\i etc., ultimately from Pers. \Isusmar\i) is, of course, untenable for phonetic reasons.

The original resonant within the root is -r-, as seen from the PAT form and from external evidence; -n- in PAK may be due to assimilation (e.g. \I*p:čˊ:ardǝna-\i > \I*p:čˊ:anda-\i). In general the Abkh. and PAK forms are in very good correlation, thus their different etymologies in Shagirov 1987, 86 are hardly justified (the etymologies are: "growing up together with goats" for PAK \I*p:čˊ:andaˊχʷǝ\i and "cow's thrush" for Abkh. \Iaˊ-ž̌ardʷǝna;\i both seem folk-etymological, although in the latter case Abkh. \Iaˊrdʷǝna\i 'thrush' could have influenced the form \Iaˊ-ž̌ardʷǝna\i).

See Abdokov 1973, 65. Since the PAK form can hardly be separated from Ub. and PAT, the inner analysis of PAK \I*ṗc̣aˊšχʷa\i as "black, dark" + "blue" (see Shagirov 2, 50) seems to be a folk etymology.

The dissolution of the AK root and its derivation from PWC \I*ʒˊǝ\i 'flea, fly' q.v. (Rogava 1956, 13-14) is untenable.

This analysis is also not supported by another meaning of the word, "table fork" (in Ad., Mozdok dialect of Kab.). We can, however, suppose a secondary influence of the root \I*sa\i on the Kabardian form (one would regularly expect \I*ʒāʒa\i there). External parallels also discredit Kuipers' suggestion about progressive assimilation in Ad. (\Icāca\i < \I*casa\i); it is rather the Kab. form that underwent an innovation.     Ub. \Icaca\i may be a loan from Ad., but - if we do not consider the PAK form a composite - it may as well be genuinely related (the correspondence PAK *c: : Ub. c is regular).

In all three subgroups of WC we have a delabialized uvular (after the initial labial). The labialisation, however, is to be reconstructed - otherwise (in case of PWC *qˊ) Ub. would have qˊ, not χˊ, or (in case of PWC *χˊ), the Adygh languages would have ħ, not χ. We can not distinguish between PWC *qˊʷ and *χˊʷ here because of the Adygh form (the cluster *pχ-, because of a specific development of *q in clusters, can go back to both *pχ- and *pq-).     Additional note: there is an enigmatic form in EC: Kar. \Imiʁaža\i 'wooden spoon'. It resembles Ub. \Imǝχˊāc̣ʷ\i and Abkh. \Ia-mħaˊč̣,\i but it can not correspond to them phonetically (furthermore, we have demonstrated above that the WC forms in question have a complex morphological nature).

381|*bVc:ʷV|1267|medlar|a-baˊč̌||nā-pca (Shaps.)||brǝcʷ|    The Abkh. form is probably most archaic; not quite clear is the origin of nā- in Shaps. and -r- in Ub. (cf. also Abkh. Bzyb. \Ia-braˊč̌\i). It is also possible that all the WC forms reflect an original form like \I*bVnc:ʷV\i or \I*bVmc:ʷV\i with exceptional preservation of the old medial nasal (cf. external evidence); in this case the Ad. form should be treated as a metathesis ( < \I*banca\i), and the forms with -r- - as a result of denasalisation (-n- > -r-). In any case, the coincidence in Adyghe between \Ināpca\i 'medlar' and \Ināpca\i 'eye-brow' is, of course, purely fortuitous.
382|*qˊʷa|1269|pear|a-ħaˊ|ħa|q:ʷǝzˊǝ|qʷǝzˊ|χˊa|    PAT \I*ħa;\i PAK \I*qʷǝ-zˊǝˊ\i (on the meaning of \I*zˊǝ\i see \I*žˊʷǝ\i). Shagirov (1, 238-239) justly notices that Trubetzkoy (1930, 276) was wrong in separating the Abkh. and Ub. forms and relating them to different EC roots. The correspondence PAT *ħ : PAK *qʷ : Ub. χˊ points regularly to PWC *qˊʷ.     See Meˊszaˊros 1934, 378; Balkarov 1969, 177; Shagirov 1, 238-239.

Despite Vogt, Ub. \ImIa-šʷǝˊ\i for obvious semantic reasons can not be a diminutive from \ImIa\i "apple". More probably, the association with the diminutive -šʷǝ is secondary (although it could have been the reason for irregular devoicing *žʷǝ > šʷǝ). An indirect proof that this was the case is Georg. \Imažalo\i 'wild apple-tree', which could have been borrowed from a language like Proto-Ubykh (before the devoicing).
384|*q̇ǝča|1272|peach|||q:ǝca|q:ǝca (dial.)||    PAK \I*q:ǝcaˊ.\i The PAK *q: can go back to PWC *q̇, *q:, *q̇I or *q:I; the PAK *-c- - to *c, *cˊ or *č. Shagirov's etymology (\I*q:ǝ\i 'plum' + \I*cǝ\i 'hair', see Shagirov 1, 229-230) is hardly acceptable, especially in view of the EC evidence.     In the Adygh languages there is a constant interaction of two roots: \I*q:ǝca\i 'peach' and \I*pχʷǝ-\i 'plum' (see \I*pǝqʷV\i). The Shaps. dialect has always \Ipχʷǝ-\i (\Ipχʷǝca\i 'peach', \Ipχʷǝsˊʷṭa\i 'plum'); other dialects tend to have \Iq:ǝ-\i (cf. Ad. \Iq:ǝca\i 'peach', \Iq:ǝṗc̣a\i 'plum').

386|*mǝrǝgʷǝzˊʷǝ(~k:ʷ,ž)|1277|a sort of plum or peach|a-mǝrgʷǝˊzˊ (Bzyb.)|||||    The word is present only in compounds \Ia-mǝrgʷǝˊzˊ-pħʷa\i 'a sort of plum', \Ia-mǝrgʷǝˊzˊ-ṭama\i 'a sort of peach'. Although found only in Abkh., the root has interesting parallels in EC.

Reason for spirantization ʒ > z in Abaz. is not quite clear; perhaps it is due to Adygh influence, although the word as such can not be regarded as an Adygh loan (despite Lomtatidze 1944,209, Kondzharia 1969,8).     The correspondence PAT *ʒˊ : PAT *z points to PWC *ʒˊ or *ǯ.
391|*Łʷasǝ|203|light (of weight)|aˊ-las|lasǝ|||wasǝˊ|    PAT \I*lasǝ.\i The correspondence PAT *l : Ub. w points only to PWC *Łʷ. If the root is *sǝ (see below), one can compare (following Абдоков 1983, 150) *psǝ- in PAK \I*psǝ-nč̣ˊaˊ\i 'light; swift' > Ad. \Ipsǝnč̣a,\i Kab. \Ipsǝnsˊ̣a.\i

PAK \I*na-sǝ-\i 'come, reach (there)', \I*q:a-sǝ-\i (Ad., Kab. \Iq:a-sǝ-n\i) 'come, reach (here)'.     We must notice that in PAK probably a contamination of two PWC roots took place: on one hand, PAK \I*na-sǝ-\i and \I*q:a-sǝ-\i are exact formal matches of Bzyb. \Ia-na-sˊ-\i and \Iā-sˊ-\i (see above); on the other hand, semantically they also match perfectly Abkh. \Ia-na-ʒa-\i 'to reach (there)' and \Iā-ʒa-\i 'to reach (here)' (see under PWC \I*ʒV\i). The derived postposition PAK \I*-nasǝ\i 'until' is also exactly matching Abkh. \I-nʒa\i and Ub. \I-ōnʒa.\i See Dumeˊzil 1932, 75, 250-251; Shagirov 1, 279-280.

The original meaning of the root is 'to put' (or 'to give'): cf. with other preverbs: Abkh. \Iaˊ-kʷ-c̣a-ra,\i Abaz. (\Ijǝ\i)-kʷ-c̣a-ra 'to put'; PAK \I*na-c̣a-\i "to put an eye [ = Russ. положить глаз] > to envy, to aspire" (Ad., Kab. \Inac̣a-n\i).         AK \I*nac̣a-\i > Ub. \Inac̣ǝˊ-\i 'to wait, hope'.

399|*ḳaḳa-čˊǝ|1311|flower|a-ḳaḳačˊ|||||    This expressive stem is attested only in Abkh., but has some EC parallels.
400|*χʷǝ ( ~ *χˊʷ,*χIʷ)|1315|1 grass 2 meadow grass||ħʷ-ra 1||χʷǝ-n 2||    The root formally coincides with PWC \I*χIʷV\i 'to graze' (q.v.); this is probably secondary.
401|*pǝč̣ˊa|1318|to weed|||ṗč̣ˊa-|ṗsˊ̣a-||    PAK \I*ṗč̣ˊa-.\i The root is unknown outside the AK area (Klimov's comparison with Abkh. \Ia-bc̣a-ra\i 'to mow' /see Klimov 1967, 299/ should be abandoned for phonetic reasons). Other etymological attempts (see Shagirov 2, 53 with literature) had also been unsuccessful.

404|*b-ǯˊǝ(-nǝ)|1328|onion|a-ǯˊǝmšˊǝˊ|ǯˊǝmšˊǝ|bžˊǝnǝ|bzˊǝn|žʷamλǝˊ|    The pure stem (with an old suffix *-nǝ) is present in PAK \I*bžˊǝnǝˊ.\i Ub. and PAT (and PAK with the meaning 'garlic') reflect old compounds \I*bǯˊǝnǝ-pǝλˊǝ\i 'red onion' ( = "onion") and \I*bǯˊǝ(nǝ)-λʷǝ\i 'white onion' ( = "garlic") with the following reflexes:         a) \I*bǯˊǝnǝ-pǝλˊǝ\i > PAT \I*ǯˊǝn(ǝ)-pǝšˊǝ\i > \I*ǯˊǝmǝšˊǝ\i (Abkh. \Ia-ǯˊǝmšˊǝˊ,\i Abaz. \Iǯˊǝmšˊǝ\i); Ub. \I*žʷan(ǝ)-pǝλˊǝ\i > \Ižʷamλǝ;\i     b) \I*bǯˊǝ(nǝ)-λʷǝ\i > PAT \I*ǯˊǝ-šǝ\i > (with assimilation) \I*ǯǝšǝ\i (Abkh. \Ia-ǯǝˊš,\i Abaz. \Iǯǝš\i); Ub. \I*žʷa-sʷa\i > (with assimilation) \Ižʷaˊšʷa;\i PAK \I*bžˊǝnǝˊ-xʷǝ\i (Ad. \Ibžˊǝnǝf,\i Kab. \Ibzˊǝnǝxʷ\i).     See Rogava 1956, 16-17, 77-78.     Although it was obviously a folk etymology, already in PWC the root of these compounds was associated with PWC \I*bǯˊV\i 'to fry' (q.v.). Since in Ub. the PWC verb \I*bǯˊV\i was superseded by a reflex of \I*zˊʷV\i 'to roast' (q.v.) > Ub. \Ižʷa-,\i \I*bǯˊV-\i was changed to \Ižʷa-\i also in the name of onion/garlic (which explains the irregular reflex žʷ instead of expected *ǯˊ-).     Not quite clear is the status of the syllable *-nǝ in PWC. Shagirov (1,91) tries to explain it as an instrumental morpheme, thus treating PAK \I*bžˊǝnǝˊ\i as 'smth. to be fried'. However, this *-nǝ is certainly absent in the Ub. and PAT word for 'garlic' (Ub. \Ižʷaˊšʷa,\i PAT \I*ǯǝšǝ\i), and may have been originally just an optional connecting morpheme (possibly an original obl. base marker).

The PAT \I*pǝnǝc̣ˊa\i 'nose' is compared (by Shagirov 1972, Abdokov 1973) with Kab. \Ipanc̣ǝv\i 'tip of the nose'. Absence of this form in Ad., however, speaks rather in favour of this form's being borrowed from Abaz. (Ashkh.) \Ipǝnc̣ǝžʷ\i 'nostril(s)' - which can be probably analyzed as \Ipǝnc̣a\i 'nose' + \I-žʷ\i 'expressive suffix'. This seems to us more probable than Shagirov's (1977) analysis of \Ipǝnc̣ǝv\i as \Ipǝ\i 'nose' + \Ic̣ǝv\i 'beetle' (?).     The WC compound form \I*pʷV(nǝ)-c̣ˊa\i spread also to the neighbour languages: Georg. \Iṗinčwi,\i Arm. \Iṗinǯ\i / \Iṗinč\i 'nostril', Osset. \Ifɨnʒ\i / \Ifɨnʒ(ä\i) 'nose, tip' (see Abayev 1958; Abayev lists also Megr. \Iṗiǯi\i 'mouth' - which, according to Klimov 1963, does not belong here and descends from PK *ṗir- 'edge'. On the contrary, Klimov (1963) considers the Armenian form to be a megrelism which is hardly possible; he does not list the Georgian form).

See Balkarov 1967, 115 (PAK - Ub.). The PAK form is a compound with \I*c̣ʷǝ\i 'good' q.v.; the first part, however, (despite Dumeˊzil 1963 and Shagirov 2, 158) has certainly nothing to do with \I*ʡa\i 'hand' (as well as q̇a- in Ub. \Iq̇aq̇ǝˊ\i).

The correspondence PAK *č̣ˊ : PAT *c̣ : Ub. c̣ˊ points to the PWC lateral *ƛ̣. In PAK, however, there exists also a separate root \I*č̣a\i 'bottom' (Ad. \Ič̣a,\i Kab. \Isˊ̣a\i) - which can reflect a variant with labialisation \I*ƛ̣ʷV\i (perhaps reflecting an early PWC metathesised variant \I*Hnŏƛ̣ŭ\i).

433|*ba[q:I]V|1436|1 shed, cattle-shed 2 fortress, castle|a-bāˊ 2|||baq 1||    The Abkh. form presupposes PAT \I*baʕa\i (\I*bǝʕa\i), where -ʕ- < PWC *-q:I-. In Kab. one would rather expect -q: and not -q (a regular PAK match for PAT \I*baʕa\i would be \I*baq:V\i). This form must have indeed existed and is reflected in the Abaz. loan from Kabardian - \Ibaq̇\i 'cattle-shed' (where q̇ is a regular Abaz. substitute for Kab. q: in loanwords). The reason for weakening -q: > -q in modern Kabardian is not quite clear. From the semantic point of view the correlation "cattle-shed" : "fortress" is not surprising, because it is known that towers/fortresses were used for keeping cattle.     Armenian \Ibak\i 'sheep-fold, enclosure' is probably of Caucasian origin, see Acharyan 1, 907 (although it may be borrowed also from Georg. \Ibaḳi\i 'fence, enclosure' - which, for phonetic reasons, can not be compared with WC forms - despite Kuipers 1960, 83, Shagirov 1, 73).

See Shagirov 2, 137. The seemingly obvious relationship of PAK \I*čˊa\i and Ub. \Ičˊa\i 'milk' is actually somewhat more complicated. A regular Ubykh reflex of PWC \I*ƛǝ\i would be \Išˊa;\i that is why the Ub. \Ičˊa\i matches not this root, but rather PAT \I*čˊǝ\i 'udder' (q.v.). The meaning of Ub. \Ičˊa\i could have been influenced by Adygh forms. Abdokov (1983, 134-135) prefers to reconstruct WC \I*čˊa\i while comparing PAK \I*čˊa\i 'milk' with Abaz. (Ashkh.) \Ičˊata,\i Abkh. \Ia-χ-č̣ˊaˊt\i 'sour  cream, cream' ( = PAK \I*čˊata\i > Ad. \Išˊāta,\i Kab. \Išāta\i id.)., cf. also Ub. \Ičˊātaˊ\i  id. It is, however, most probable that all AT forms and the Ub. form are later loanwords from Adygh (see Shagirov 2, 136 with literature).     PAT \I*xǝ-šǝ\i 'milk' is an exact match for PAK \I*čˊǝ-xʷǝ\i ( > Kab. \Išxʷǝ;\i also  with metathesis \I*čˊxǝwǝ\i > Ad. \Išˊxǝwǝ\i) 'sour milk', going back to a PWC  compound \I*ƛǝ-λʷǝ\i 'white milk' (see Shagirov 2, 140); which is why Abdokov's  separate comparison of PAK \I*-xʷǝ\i in this compound with Av. \Irax\i is unacceptable.

Since the EC counterpart of the root means both 'sour' and 'raw' (a natural and frequent semantic correlation), it seems possible to compare also (with a secondary loss of initial labial) PAK \I*c̣ǝ-naˊ\i (Ad., Kab. \Ic̣ǝna\i) 'raw' (also borrowed in Ub.: \Ic̣ǝna\i id., see Shagirov 2, 126).

In Ub. cf. also \Isʷǝ-pǝˊ\i 'flour' (the meaning of the second components -bIa, -pǝ is not quite clear).     The correspondence PAT *š : PAK *xʷ : Ub. sʷ points unambiguosly to PWC *λʷ. All other comparison attempts within WC (PAK \I*xʷǝ\i : Ub. \Iχʷa\i 'millet, grain' - see Meˊszaˊros 1934, 386; PAT \I*šǝ\i : PAK \I*mačˊǝ\i - see Shakryl 1968, 53, 98; PAK \I*xʷǝ\i : PAT \I*qʷǝ-ʒˊǝ\i 'pounded millet' - see Rogava 1956, 121) are unacceptable and unnecessary.

Despite Shagirov 2, 134 the Abkh. form is not a loan from Adygh (the meaning is different, and in the case of borrowing we would expect Abkh. č̣ˊ, not č̣).

If Osset. \Ibarc\i / \Ibarcä\i 'mane' really goes back to Proto-Iran. \I*barša-\i (see Abayev 1, 237; doubts are raised by Osset. -c-), then the forms PAK \I*bǝraˊca\i and PAT \I*pǝrǝcʷǝ\i should be regarded as Alanisms; otherwise the direction of loan should be reversed and the WC forms analysed on WC ground (cf. PAT \I*bǝra\i and PWC \I*cǝ\i / \I*cʷǝ\i 'hair').     Abdokov (1983, 73) compares the WC forms with PEC \I*balV\i 'wool' (q.v.),  which seems phonetically less probable. He also cites Chech. \I=älla\i 'hairy' -  which is in reality a participle of \I=āl-\i 'to grow' and does not belong here at  all.

The Ad. form is ingeniously explained by Shagirov (1, 172) as a contraction from the erg.-obl. case \I*jaz-šˊ\i < \I*jazǝ-šˊ\i (-šˊ is the normal ending of this case in Ad. pronouns, but \Ijažˊ\i in the Bzhedugh dialect has no ending either in the erg.-obl. case or in the nominative case).         Because of an obvious connection in EC, Yakovlev's etymology of \I*-zǝ\i ( = \I*zǝ\i 'one', see Yakovlev 1948, 69, 143, Shagirov 1, 173) should be abandoned.
485|*k:ǝṭʷV ( ~ g-)|1591|1 axe 2 spear||||ǯǝda 1|gˊǝṭʷǝˊ 2|    For Kab. the old form \Igˊǝda\i is recorded - therefore the loan from Turk. \Ijɨda\i or Mong. \Iǯida\i 'spear' is impossible (despite Shagirov 1, 162). The same is true for Ub. \Igˊǝṭʷǝˊ\i (def. \Iaˊ-gˊǝṭʷ\i).     Kab. \Iǯǝda\i presupposes PAK \I*gǝda\i or \I*k:ǝt:a\i (unfortunately, the corresponding Ad. word is not preserved); Ub. -ṭʷ- shows that the second consonant was glottalised (with assimilation in PAK).

The need to see a colour name in the second part of the AK and Ub. compound is obvious: both in AK and Ub. the name of iron forms part of an opposition - in AK \I*ʁʷa-pλaˊ\i 'metal' + 'red' = 'copper, red copper' : \I*ʁʷǝ-č̣ǝˊ\i 'metal' + '?' = 'iron'. In Ub. \Iwǝ-sʷaˊ\i 'metal' + 'white' = 'copper, bronze' : \Iwǝ-c̣ʷaˊ\i 'metal' + '?' = 'iron'. If we assume that the Ub. and AK words for 'iron' are genetically related (certainly, the theory of Ub. \Iwǝc̣ʷaˊ\i being an Adygh loanword, see Shagirov 1, 140, can not be considered seriously), the correspondence PAK *č̣ : Ub. c̣ʷ is unambiguously pointing to the PWC lateral labialised *ƛ̣ʷ, for which the expected PAT correspondence is *c̣ʷ - and we find it in PAT \I*ja-c̣ʷa\i 'blue'.     The concept of iron being a "blue metal" is by no means strange: it goes back to one of the earliest varieties of tempered iron (steel), which was in Greek called \Ikuˊanos\i (cyan) and was dark-blue in colour (on the etymology of this word and the related Hitt. \Ikuwanna-\i see under \I*kwɨ̄wV\i). We must also mention the widespread Caucasian myth about the birth of the cultural hero from a blue stone - which metaphorically depicts the ritual of tempering iron (see in greater detail Ardzinba 1985).     In view of all this the theory of Yakovlev (1941, 140-141), Shagirov (1,  140-141) who tried to explain PAK \I*ʁʷǝč̣ǝˊ\i as "dried (\Iʁʷǝ-\i) earth (\Ič̣ǝ\i)" must be obviously taken as a folk etymology. Far more right was Abdokov (1973, 48) who thought the AK and Ubykh words genetically related and explained \I*ʁʷǝ-\i as "metal" and \I*-č̣ǝ\i as a colour-name. He proposed to consider the second part as "grey", not specifying, however, what particular root he had in mind (thus invoking Shagirov's criticism). Shagirov is right, indeed, that PAK \I*č̣ˊǝxʷǝ\i 'light-blue, pale' (Ad. \Ič̣ˊǝfǝ,\i Kab. \Isˊ̣ǝxʷ\i) can not be involved (it has č̣ˊ, not č̣). For Ubykh Abdokov probably meant the root present in Ub. \Icʷa-baˊ\i 'greyish' - which is actually possible (note a quite analogous variation c̣ʷ / cʷ in the Ub. reflexes of PWC \I*ƛ̣ʷV\i 'earth' q.v.).     There is more to be said about the hypothetical PWC \I*ʁˊIʷǝƛ̣ʷV\i 'iron'. Since several authors relate the Hatti language to WC (see, e.g., Ivanov 1985), it seems very tempting to relate \I*ʁˊIʷǝƛ̣ʷV\i to the attested Hatti name for 'iron', \Iχap/walki\i (with χVw- rendering *ʁˊIʷ- and -lk- rendering the lateral -ƛ̣-), borrowed in Hurrian as \Iχabalgi,\i and further - Greek \Ikhalkoˊ-s,\i Balto-Slav. \I*gelegˊ-\i etc. (see Starostin 1985).

Abkh.: \Iaˊ-č̌-matʷa\i 'plough' (\I-matʷa\i 'thing'), \Ia-č̌-eˊjχa\i 'ploughshare' (\Iaˊjχa\i 'iron'), \Ia-č̌-mā\i 'ploughhandle' (\Ia-māˊ\i 'handle), \Ia-č̌a-ʁʷa-ra\i 'to plough' (lit.

All these data leave no doubt in the existence of a separate PWC root \I*c:ʷa\i 'plough'. Shagirov (1, 104-105) is quite right in distinguishing this root from PWC \I*c:ʷǝ\i 'ox'; however, his proposal to consider it the same morpheme as \I*zʷa\i 'to plough' (q.v.) can not be accepted - all languages clearly distinguish these two roots phonetically.

The voiceless *-s- in PAK \I*wa-saˊ-psǝ\i (a compound with \Iwa-\i 'sky' and \I-psǝ\i 'water') is conditioned by the influence of another root, PAK \I*wa-sǝˊ\i 'snow' ( < PWC \I*sˊǝ\i q.v.).

The element *-(ǝm)-ba in PAK is not quite clear. Despite Dumeˊzil (1932, 107, 108), the AK form can not be related to Ub. \Išχʷabǝˊ\i 'foam', since the latter is clearly connected with PAT \I*sʷaqǝ\i 'foam' ( < PWC \I*šʷaq:V\i q.v.).

PAK \I*jǝ-ʁʷaˊ\i contains a pronominal prefix *jǝ-. PWC \I*ʁˊIʷa\i should be kept separate from PWC \I*ʁˊa\i 'time, age' (q.v.): although reflexes of both roots have merged in PAT \I*ʕa-,\i the PAT form \I*ʕa-pǝ-(nǝ\i) 'spring' is very hard to separate from Ub. \Iwa-faˊ-da,\i and PAT *ʕ (instead of expected *ʕʷ) must be explained by dissimilatory delabialisation (before following *-p-). In AK and Ubykh the two roots are still quite distinctly opposed.

The original meaning is 'now', 'this (time)', as seen both from the compounds and from the external evidence.

Because of this reconstruction, Charaya's (1912) comparison of the WC forms with Georg. \Ieri\i 'people, nation' seems possible (despite Shagirov 1).

Shagirov 1, 244 considers \I-bza\i here to be derived from \Ibzǝ-n\i 'to cut' (q.v.); the external parallels, however, provide another explanation.

Initial n- in the PAK form may be due to fronting assimilation (before a dental -z-).     The correspondence PAT *ʒˊ : PAK *z points to PWC *ʒˊ or *ǯ; the former is preferable in view of the external evidence.
543|*lˊV|1731|cubit|ra-ḳ|||||    The Abkh. form contains a singulative suffix -ḳ, thus the pure root is ra-. Unfortunately, no related forms are known in other WC languages, so the reconstruction is rather vague (*r-, *rˊ- or *lˊ- possible - we have chosen *lˊ, because it corresponds well to the EC data).
544|*ǯa|1732|span|aˊ-ʒa|ʒa|bžiz|bzˊiz|ʒa|    PAT \I*ʒˊa\i (cf. also Bzyb. \Iaˊ-ʒˊa\i).

We consider, however, the direct comparison of PAK \I*jǝ-zǝ\i (jǝ- is a usual pronominal prefix) with PAT \I*ʒˊa\i and Ub. \Iʒa\i 'span' more justified semantically, and quite regular phonetically - thus, the coincidence with \I*jǝˊzǝ\i 'full' is certainly secondary.     See Shagirov 1, 90; Klimov 1967, 306; Balkarov 1967, 15, 24.
545|*maq:V|1735|sound, voice|||māq:a|māq:||    PAK \I*maq:Vˊ.\i In view of the external evidence the root should be treated as a whole, and Shagirov's (1,259) hypothesis about its morphological complexity does not seem convincing.

In PAK *čˊ:- would be expected, but only the Kab. form is known (Kab. ž can go back to PAK *čˊ:, *č:, *ǯˊ). Still, the exact parallelism between Kab. \Ižǝʡa-\i and Ub. \Ičǝq̇a-\i (where the second part goes back to \I*q̇ˊIa-\i 'say' q.v.) makes this etymology quite plausible.     The comparison of Kab. \Ižǝ-ʡa-\i and Abkh. \Iaˊž̌a\i was first proposed by Meˊszaros (1934, 308), who also compared Ub. \Imasˊa\i 'word' which is impossible for phonetic reasons.

549|*nǝsa ( ~ -š-)|1745|1 daughter-in-law 2 sister-in-law|||nǝsa 1|nǝsa 1|nǝsaˊ-ʁ 2|    PAK *nǝsaˊ. Shagirov 1, 288 supposes that the Ub. form is borrowed from Adygh (PAK \I*nǝsaˊ-ʁʷǝ\i 'sister-in-law'); but this supposition does not explain loss of labialisation in Ub. It seems more probable that the Ub. and AK forms are genetically related. Despite Abdokov 1973, 62 the AK and Ub. words can not be related to Abkh. \Iaca,\i Abaz. \Itaca,\i Ub. \Isˊasˊa\i 'bride, daughter-in-law' (see Shagirov ibid.).     The Adygh forms were borrowed in Osset. (Dig.) \Inissä\i 'lady', Chan. \Inisaʁa,\i \Inusaʁa\i 'two daughters-in-law'. The latter form (undoubtedly borrowed < PAK \I*nǝsaʁʷǝ\i) makes it probable that other scattered Kartvelian forms (Georg. \Inusa-dia\i 'sister-in-law', Megr. \Inosa,\i \Inisa,\i Chan. \Inusa,\i \Inisa\i 'daughter-in-law') also have a WC origin.

The basic variant was obviously \I*sˊʷasa\i (PAK *sˊ can only go back to a labialized *sˊʷ).

This seems to us less likely, because Ub. \Iṗc̣ˊa\i has a different etymology (see PWC \I*ṗǝzˊV\i 'clean'), and we prefer to follow Abdokov (1973, 57, 65).

The comparison of PAT *qʷa- and PAK *q:ʷa- belongs to Abdokov (1973,55), and is certainly better than Klimov's (1967, 306) comparison of PAT \I*qʷa-\i with PAK \I*wǝ-xʷa-\i 'to bend' (absolutely impossible phonetically). Abdokov adds also Ub. \Iq̇ʷarṭa-\i (\Isǝ-q̇ʷarṭaˊ-n\i) 'to bend, be(come) crooked', but for phonetic reasons it seems better to choose Ub. \Iq̇Iʷǝ-\i 'to bend' (thus following Shagirov 1,230). [Shagirov compares also Abkh. \Ia-r-q̇ʷ-ra\i 'to bend (trans.), Abaz. \Ičǝ-na-r-q̇ʷ-ra\i 'to bend', but this is a misunderstanding: the root here is PAT \I*q̇ʷǝ\i 'to lower, go down', and the meaning 'bend' is metaphorical (applied to fortune, circumstances and the like).]     Besides PWC \I*q̇IʷV-\i the WC languages also reflect a phonetically close variant: \I*q̇ˊIʷV-,\i present in a compound \I*q̇ˊIʷV-rṭV\i / \I*q̇ˊIʷV-nṭV:\i Ub. \Iq̇ʷarṭaˊ-\i (see above), PAK \I*ʡʷanṭa-\i / \I*ʡʷarṭa-\i (Ad. \Iʡʷanṭa-,\i Shaps. \Iʡʷarṭa-\i 'to bend, crook', Kab. \Iʡʷanṭa-\i 'to twist').

Semantically and phonetically the forms are very close, and the correspondence PAT *ɣˊ : PāK *ɣ : Ub. ʁ points to the PWC palatalised lateral *Łˊ. Therefore Shagirov's explanation of the Adygh form as \I*pa\i 'nose' + \I*bɣǝ\i 'mountain' is hardly acceptable (although an analogy with \I*pa\i 'nose' is possible).

PAK \I*ṗc̣ˊǝ\i can only go back to PWC \I*P-c̣ˊʷǝ\i (a form which obviously corresponds to EC, see Trubetzkoy 1930, 82). The Ubykh form can go back to a voiced variant \I*zˊʷǝ;\i but the PAT form needs a more complicated explanation, if it belongs here at all: it may also reflect a secondarily voiced PWC variant \I*(b)-ʒˊʷV\i > PAT \I*ža,\i with labialisation under the influence of PAT \I*zʷǝ\i 'nine' (\I*ža\i > \I*žʷa\i ).         The hypothesis of uniting all three forms (PAT, PAK and Ub.) belongs to Abdokov (1973, 66). One can either accept it (with the complicated explanation presented above), or else separate the Ub. and Abkh. forms under a distinct protoform, PWC \I*žˊʷV\i (since *žˊʷ regularly gives PAT *žʷ and Ub. žʷ). However, Shagirov's attempt to unite Abkh. \Iž̌-ba\i 'nine' and \Iž̌a-ba\i 'ten' (Shagirov 1, 80-81) is certainly untenable: in the Bzyb. dialect they are opposed as \Izˊ̌-ba\i vs. \Iž̌-ba\i and go back to different PAT forms (\I*zʷǝ\i and \I*žʷa\i respectively).

Ub. \Isǝ-šˊǝˊ-n.\i     Shagirov (1,280;2,108) compares (with some doubt) Ub. \Išˊǝ-\i with PAK \I*sˊǝ-\i (apparently used in some compounds with the meaning 'to become'), but concedes himself that phonetically such a comparison is impossible. Despite Dumeˊzil  1938, 74 and Shagirov 2, 113, PAT \I*-xa-\i can not be related to PAK \I*χʷǝ-\i 'to  become' (for phonetic reasons).

(see Yakovlev 1941, 210), but the latter seems to have a separate EC parallel. Despite Shagirov (1,178), however, Ub. \Iχa\i 'bottom' can be connected neither with PAK \I*ja-xǝ-,\i nor with PAK \I*xǝ\i 'bottom'.

In Ub. variants \Iwa(n)ʒˊaˊ\i and \IwIa(n)ǯaˊ\i are attested; wa- here can be treated as a prefix meaning 'to do, execute'. The Kab. word means literally 'to make (-sˊ̣ǝ-n) a secret (bzǝ-)'. See Shagirov 1,97.     PAT \I*ʒˊa-\i can, in fact, reflect a merger of two WC roots: cf. also \I*cˊ:ǝ-\i > Ub. \Iwǝ-cˊǝ-\i 'to steal' (perhaps also -psˊ- in Kab. \Iʁa-psˊ-ḳʷǝ-n\i 'to hide'?).

For phonetic reasons the comparison of PAK \I*č:a-\i and Ub. \I-čˊa-\i (pointing to PWC \I*čˊ:ʷa-\i) is preferable to other comparisons: PAK \I*č:a-\i and Ub. \Ižaja\i 'swift' (Meˊszaˊros 1934, 326); PAK \I*č:a-\i and PAT \I*cˊa-\i 'to go' (Shagirov 1, 193).

Since, despite Dumeˊzil (1932, 107-108), PAK *t can not correspond to Ub. sˊ, we have to admit that the meaning 'to lift, raise' is here expressed by the component PAK \I*ʡa-,\i Ub. \Iq̇a-\i < PWC \I*qˊ:Ia-\i (or \I*q̇ˊIa-\i), which must be therefore distinguished from the homonymous PWC root for 'hand' (q.v.).

For PWC we can also reconstruct a compound \I*zˊV-ʁʷV\i (besides the listed forms cf. also Kab. \Iwǝzǝʁʷa\i = \Iwǝzǝ\i); the second part (*-ʁʷV) is not quite clear etymologically (it can be attributed to several PWC roots).

This is an additional factor in favour of Kuipers' hypothesis that PAK \I*tħa\i originally had meant 'life, breath'. Since PAK \I*tħa\i corresponds well to Ub. \ILa\i (going back to PWC \I*Ła\i), all other theories about the origin of PAK \I*tħa\i (comparison with Greek \Itheoˊs,\i fantastic comparisons with \I*ħa\i 'dog', \I*t:ǝʁa\i 'sun' etc. - see the full list in Shagirov 2,79-80) should be discarded.

Since PAK *čˊ = Ub. čˊ and PAK *x = Ub. šʷ, it seems very probable to compare the words in whole (assuming a metathesis in one of the subgroups). The PAT form \I*čˊčˊa\i can be easily explained as a result of assimilation < \I*šǝčˊa\i (where *š < *λˊʷ and *čˊ < *čˊ). Therefore the commonly accepted comparison of Abkh. \I-čˊčˊa-\i with PK \I*cc-\i 'to laugh' (Charaya 1912, 48, Shagirov ibid etc.) seems rather superficial. If PWC \I*λˊʷV-čˊV-\i (\I*čˊV-λˊʷV\i) is a compound verb, only its component \I*čˊV\i can be compared with Kartvelian (we should add that both forms are probably onomatopeic in origin); the component \I*λˊʷV\i is certainly related to EC forms meaning 'to laugh'.

The PAT form can be related to Ubykh if we assume a metathesis (\I*ḳamǝsˊǝ\i < \I*sˊVmVḳV\i) and assimilative / dissimilative processes - which is not surprising in an expressive root like this (cf., e.g., numerous irregularities in the IE root for 'ant' - \I*morm-\i / \I*morw-\i / \I*bhorm-\i etc.).

[other similar forms - God., Botl., Tind., Cham. \Idurc,\i Gunz., Bezht. \Idursa\i - are all more or less recent loanwords from Avar]).

Within PAK it seems probable to relate here the stem \I*žaʁʷǝˊ\i (Ad. \Ižaʁʷǝ\i 'chin', Kab. \Izˊaʁʷ\i 'base of the lower jaw'), although regularly one would expect a form like \I*ʒa(m)ʁʷǝ\i or \I*za(m)ʁʷǝ\i. The irregularity should be explained by a secondary influence of the PAK root \I*ža\i 'mouth' (q.v.).

The same root (reduplicated, or at least constituting the first part of a compound) can be found in PAK \I*gagʷǝ-\i 'to play' (Ad. \Iǯˊagʷǝ-n,\i Kab. \Iǯagʷǝ-n\i), \I*gaˊgʷǝ\i 'play, feast, wedding' (Ad. \Iǯˊagʷ,\i Kab. \Iǯagʷ\i).     The semantic correlation "to dance, play" - "to be silly" recurs in the  same root in EC languages as well, thus the relationship between AT and other  WC forms seems secure enough.

Since, however, PAT \I*mǝza\i and Ub. \Imǝʒaˊ\i 'candle, light' certainly constitute a different root (obviously having nothing to do with \I*bǝzˊa\i 'tongue'), it seems probable that in PAK the two different PWC roots had merged (phonetically this is quite regular).

(Abdokov gives also the meaning 'spend some time',  whereas the Kab.-Russ. dictonary only gives the gloss 'to graze (at night, of horses, oxen etc.)'. Adyghe reflects only the compound \I*pšˊǝ-ṗq̇a\i 'place of temporary abode', 'hut' (borrowed in Ub. as \Ipšˊǝṗq̇aˊ\i 'lieu d'assembleˊe en plein air'); cf. also another derivate in Kab. \Ipsˊǝ-ʡa\i 'hut'.     See Abdokov 1983, 128-129 with the correct AT-AK comparison (the author  quotes also an Ub. verb \Ipšˊǝ-\i 'to abide, stay temporarily' - which we were  unable to identify and which is probably faulty: in Ub. we should regularly  expect a form like \Ipsˊǝ-\i). Because of the obvious AT cognate, Shagirov's  identification of the present root with PWC \I*pǝλ:ʷa\i 'to blow' (q.v.) should  certainly be rejected.

709|*sǝ|2006|wood, timber|||||sǝ|    Ub. def. \Iaˊ-s.\i Further connections of this word within WC are not quite  clear. Shagirov (1972, 137; 2, 60) and Abdokov (1983, 132) find a cognate in  Abkh., Abaz. \I-s(ǝ)\i 'suffix denoting material' (Abaz. \Iqǝlpa\i 'hat', \Iqǝlpa-s\i  'stuff for making hats' etc.) - on the analogy with a synonymous Adygh  morpheme \I-pχa\i going back to a root meaning 'wood'.     A probable derivate in Ub. is \Isǝ-χǝˊ\i 'horizontal bar, bolt, pole' (from  \Isǝ-\i 'wood' + \I-χǝ\i 'a possessive particle'). If this derivation is true, we must  admit an interesting fact of the further expansion of this term throughout the  Caucasus: to Adygh languages (Ad. \Isax\i 'bolt', Kab. \Isax\i 'post,pole'), whence Abkh. \Ia-saˊkˊ\i 'bolt', Abaz. (Ashkh.) \Isakˊ\i 'a pole for locking the gate',  and further - Osset. \Isäux\i 'post, pole' and Avar \Is:ak\i 'bridge support,  abutment'. See Shagirov 2, 60.
