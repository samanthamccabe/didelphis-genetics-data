PAT \I*qʷa,\i PAK \I*tχʷa/*tχʷǝ.\i The cluster *tq:ʷ- may in fact have been *rq:ʷ- or *lq:ʷ- (since the number of clusters in PWC is restricted), which would be a better match for the EC forms.
4|*jaɣˊa|364|ashes|||jāžˊa|jāzˊa||    PAK \I*jažˊaˊ.\i The word has no PAT or Ub. parallels, but reliable correspondences in PEC - thus the inner PAK etymology proposed in Шагиров 1, 169 (ja- - same as in \I*jatˀa\i 'clay, dirt', -žˊa - related to PAK \I*žˊǝ\i 'wind, air') seems less convincing.

(we should note that roots of the type mVKʷV are indeed very rare in Ub.). Comparison of Ub. \Inǝkˀʷǝˊ\i with PAK \I*kˀʷaˊcˀǝ\i 'intestines' (Шагиров 1, 217) is not persuasive.

9|*čʷǝχʷa|5|1 big 2 strong|||-šxʷa 1|-šxʷa 1|šχʷa 2|    Seems to be less used in modern Kab. (in Ad. this is the main word for 'big'). PAK \I*čxʷa.\i The AK-Ub. comparison belongs to Dumeˊzil (1932, 95). Klimov (1969, 290) has compared the AK root with Abkh. \Ia-mcχʷ\i 'surplus'; this comparison is, however, justly rejected by Shagirov (2, 61-62) (both for phonetic and semantic reasons).         The precise nature of the initial PWC affricate here is hard to determine, since both in PAK and Ub. the initial clusters of the type 'affricate+fricative' are substantially restricted (in Ub. all affricates change to fricatives in this position; in PAK palatalized/non-palatalized affricates are neutralised before fricatives). Position within a cluster also explains the change of uvular to velar in PAK (no combinations of front affricates + uvular fricatives are allowed).
10|*jǝnǝ|687|big|||jǝnǝ|jǝn||    PAK *jǝnǝˊ. Etymology obscure (relationship to Ub. wa 'long', proposed in Шагиров 1,185 is dubious - since the only two secure cases of n:w correspondence between PAK and Ub. occur after labialised consonants, which is not the case in the present root).

Abkh. \Ia-jkʷaˊ\i dark'). \I-cˀʷa\i can not be treated here as the same root as PAT \I*jacˀʷa\i 'blue, green' (q.v.) for accentological reasons: \Ia-jkʷaˊ(j)cˀˇa\i would be expected in Abkh.).         The PAK word \I*cˀʷǝcˀa\i 'black' goes back (as proposed by Шагиров 2, 103) to \I*cˀʷǝ\i 'black' + \I*pˀcˀa-\i 'thick, dense' with secondary elision of -pˀ-; the root \I*cˀʷA\i 'black' is used also in a number of other compounds.         Since exactly the same correspondence is present in the word for 'fire' (q.v.) one can not separate the Ub. form from the rest, but problems remain: we have to account for deglottalisation and delabialisation of the root consonant. We can, however, suppose that the original form is still preserved in the word for 'coal': Ub. \Igˊaˊ(n)-cˀʷa,\i cf. PAK \I*cˀʷa-mǝčˀˊǝ\i id.

Ub. \Ipqǝ\i (\Iaˊ-pq\i) 'bone' is considered (see Шагиров 2,48) an Adygh loan (as also Abaz. \Ipˀqˀǝ\i 'carcass, skeleton'), which must be true (otherwise we should expect pharyngealised -qI(ʷ)- in Ub.).

Origins of Ad. -t- are not very clear (perhaps a contamination with \Ipšˊta-\i 'to boil' - cf. Kab. \Ipsˊtǝ-r\i 'hot' /derived from \Ipsˊtǝ-n\i 'boil'/ along with \Isǝr\i 'burning, scorching' = Ad. \Istǝ-r\i 'hot; burning, scorching').

That is why Abaz.  \Išˊajʒa\i 'root' (having no Abkhaz counterpart) should rather be regarded as an  old Adygh loanword (although -j- instead of -b- is rather hard to explain).     Ub. \I-žʷa\i (probably with a late dissimilative loss of initial labial) is present in compounds \Iqˀa(n)cʷa-žʷaˊ \i 'fingernail' (\Iqˀancʷa\i 'finger') and \Išˊa(n)cʷa-žʷaˊ \i'toenail' (\Išˊa(n)cʷa\i 'toe'). Abdokov (1983, 82) cites Ub. \Ibžˊa\i  'horn' which is probably non-existant (while Abkh. \Ia-msa\i 'horn', also cited  ibid., goes back to PWC \I*pǝ˜ša\i q.v.).
25|*pǝsǝtA (?)|696|cloud|a-pstħʷa|pstħwa||||    In Abkh. there coexist variants aˊ-pta and aˊ-pstħʷa (bz. aˊ-pstħʷa). The variant aˊ-pta may be explained by a secondary elision of -s- to avoid contamination with a-psta 'ravine' (see Шагиров 2, 28); we may also accept Shagirov's explanation (ibid.) of -ħʷa as an unvoiced variant of *ʕʷa 'smoke' (q.v.). We are thus left with the PAT root *pǝsǝtA 'cloud' whose further etymology is unclear.     Shagirov's attempt (ibid.) to explain *pǝsǝtA from *pǝsǝ 'water, liquid' + *tA 'to give' must be rejected on accent grounds: the root *pǝsA 'to wet, liquid' (q.v.) belongs to the dominant accent class in PAT and we should expect the accentuation *a-psǝˊta (*a-psaˊta) in Abkh. Abdokov's (1973, 27, 64) comparison with PAK *pčˊa 'cloud', *pčˊaˊʁʷa 'fog' must be rejected on phonetic grounds.

It is harder to account for deglottalisation in Ub.; in any case, the PAK and Ub. forms are obviously related. Cf. also Ub. impers. \Ia-čˊǝˊ\i 'it is cold'.     Despite Shagirov (2, 154) PAK \I*čˀˊǝ\i 'winter' .and. \I*pˀǝčˀˊa-\i 'to freeze' should be strictly kept apart from this root (they have a different root consonant); PAT \I*cˀǝʕa\i / \I*cˀǝħa\i 'ice' also should be separated (the PAT *cˀ : PAK *čˀ correspondence does not exist).

This is probably due to the influence of \I*psǝ\i 'water' (very frequent in combination with the verb 'to drink').     The original meaning of the root - as it is clearly seen on external evidence - was 'to milk, (to drink milk)'. Derivates from this root mean 'milch cow, cow' in many EC languages. Hence it is natural to relate to this root also PWC \I*zʷǝ\i / \I*mǝ-zʷǝ\i 'cow' (with *mǝ- as a probable deverbative prefix): PAT \I*zʷǝ\i (Abkh. \Iaˊ-žˇ,\i Bzyb. \Iaˊ-zˊˇ,\i Abaz. \Ižʷǝ\i) 'cow', Ub. \Imǝzʷ-ʁǝˊ\i 'heifer'.

PAT \I*ʒˊǝ-\i in this verb is probably a modification of the reciprocal version prefix *-zˊǝ- (which is semantically rather plausible). The element corresponding to PAK *d and Ub. L here must be PAT *r (*-rǝʕʷǝ-) which (despite Shagirov ibid.), of course, can not be considered a causative prefix (the verb has no causative semantics at all). For the second part of this PWC compound see \I*q:ˊIʷǝ-.\i The root \I*da-\i ( < \I*lˊa-\i) is present in another PAK compound \I*da-gʷǝˊ\i 'deaf' (where -gʷǝ is a privative suffix: "earless"), see Шагиров 1, 145. Judging from the external evidence, the variant with the resonant \I*lˊA\i is original; reasons for its transformation into a lateral affricate in the word for "ear" are yet to be investigated.

Its regular Ub. correspondence is present in Ub. jǝ-cˀʷaˊ- 'on the earth' (preverb); reasons for deglottalisation of -cˀʷ- in the Ub. noun (which is certainly representing the same root) are not yet clear.      This root is to be strictly kept apart from PAK *čˀa 'bottom' which has quite different external parallels.

In AK this root has survived only within the compound \I*λa-gʷa(n)ža-mǝ-sˊħa\i 'kneeling' (\I*λa-gʷa(n)ža\i is the PAK word for 'knee').  Thus Abdokov's (1983, 79) comparison of PAT \I*mǝ-qA\i with an isolated Akhvakh  form (Akhv. \Imuqˀu\i 'knee') should be rejected.

In Ub. the root is confined to the plural (being the collective counterpart of -sǝ- q.v.).     The transitive meaning ("to put") is not attested in the verbal paradigm, but there are some nominal derivates which have preserved it: cf. Kab. \Iλa\i 'place' (*'place to put smth.'), Ub. \Iλa-šʷaˊ\i 'sheath, case' ("place (-šʷa) to put smth. in").

The second component, \I*ħA,\i is strangely enough, related by Shagirov (ibid.) to PAK \I*ħA\i 'bring, carry'. We would still like to follow Trubetzkoy in connecting the AK and Ub. forms (the ħ:w correspondence is here just the same as in the word for "dog"). However, PAT should have regularly had l-, not w- here; perhaps we should assume that PWC *Łʷ was for some reason split into l and w in PAT (position before different vowels? - there are too few examples to come to a definite conclusion).         In Ub. wa can be also discovered in the word for far (\Iλa-waˊ\i lit.

Ub. has a compound of \I*tˀa\i 'nit' + \I*cˀˊA\i 'louse' (despite Shagirov 2, 125 Ub. \Itˀakˀˊ\i 'louse' can not belong here; coincidence with -cˀˊ in \Idǝmacˀˊ\i 'egg' is probably fortuitous).

It was borrowed into Abaz. in the form pχačaqʷa - however, Shagirov is probably right in thinking that the AK word had been reinterpreted in Abaz. as pχača 'coarse-grained' (also an AK loan) + qʷa 'ashes'. Circassian pχa(r)šāχʷa 'sand' is in this case a back-loan from Abaz. Ubykh pšāχʷa 'sand' is also most probably a recent Ad. loanword.     Further etymology of PAK *pčaχʷaˊ is not clear.

In this case it does not belong here. Cf., however, Kab. \Ipsˊtǝ-r\i 'hot' and AK \I*pšˊa-\i 'to cook' which could also serve as basis for \I*pšˊ(ǝ)-tA-\i.

There exists indeed a PAT root \I*pǝsa\i 'to become wet, soak' (e.g. Abaz. \Ipsa-ra\i id., Abkh. (a-ʒǝˊ) \Ia-psaˊ-la-ra,\i Bz. (a-ʒǝˊ) \Ia-psǝˊ-la-ra\i 'throw into water') which could be compared with PAK \I*psǝ\i ( - but not with voiced bz- in Ub.!). Still it is very hard to separate the AA root \I*ʒǝ\i from Ubykh (with which it correlates even in what concerns accent), and the Ubykh one from AK. We think that in PAK there could have occurred a contamination of two original roots: \I*bzǝ\i 'water' and \I*pǝsǝ\i 'river; liquid' - this would be the best explanation of the whole situation.     Abdokov (1983, 185) compares PAT \I*ʒǝ\i with PAK \I*p:c:a-\i in \I*p:c:a-n-tħaˊ\i "glue" (Ad. \Ipcāntħa,\i Kab. \Ibʒāntħa\i). This would be fine in view of the EC data, but Shagirov (1, 81) is probably right in treating \I*p:c:a-n-tħaˊ\i as "fish glue" (with \I*p:c:a\i "fish").

190|*-a|2295|what, who (interrogative stem)|-a(-)|-a(-)||||    In Abkh. the meaning of interrogative pronouns is normally expressed by verbal suffixes -da ('who'), -j ('what'). Since d- and j- are class markers  (animate/unanimate respectively), the only morpheme to which we can ascribe the interrogative meaning is -a (probably reduced in *-ja > -j). The same morpheme can be seen in \I-a-ba-\i 'where' and independent pronouns \Id-a-rban\i 'who', \Ij-a-rban\i 'what' (the -rban suffix is not very clear etymologically - perhaps it contains the root \I*-ba-\i 'to see' q.v.?). In Abaz. the situation is analoguous - only in the function of independent pronouns we have \Id-začˀʷǝ-j-a\i 'who' and \Ij-začˀʷǝ-j-a\i (or \Iačˀʷǝja\i) 'what'. These are derived (by suffixing the same hypothetic interrogative morpheme *-a) from \Id-začˀʷ,\i \Ij-začˀʷ\i 'each'  (\Iačˀʷ\i probably had also existed) where \I-začˀʷ\i = Abkh. \I-zacˀˇǝ\i 'single' (from \I*zA\i 'one').

The precise nature of this *-dA is not clear (perhaps it reflects the PWC demonstrative *da).

With labialisation cf. Shaps. \Ipχʷǝ-sˊʷtˀa\i 'plum', \Ipχʷǝ-ca\i 'peach'. The PAK form \I*q:ǝ-pˀcˀaˊ\i 'plum' (Ad., Kab. \Iq:ǝpˀcˀa\i) is probably a modification of \I*pχ(ʷ)ǝ-pˀcˀa\i under influence of PAK \I*q:ǝcaˊ\i 'peach' which has a separate etymology (q.v.).     In Ub. the root means 'a k. of big plum'.     The WC languages have yet another root with close meaning, but without the initial labial: cf. Abaz. \Iħʷa-saˊ,\i Abkh. \Ia-ħʷa-saˊ\i 'wild plum' (in Bzyb. we have \Ia-pħʷasˊaˊ\i / \Ia-bħʷasˊaˊ\i - obviously, a result of merging \I*pǝħʷa\i 'plum' and \I*ħʷasˊa\i 'wild plum'); *-sˊa is a frequent component in names of plants. We could compare also Bzhed. \Iχǝrc\i 'peach' (as opposed to other terms with *q:- or *pχʷ-, see above). Although we can not absolutely exclude the possibility of a secondary loss of the initial labial in these forms (see Shagirov 2, 229), it is still possible to reconstruct a separate PWC root \I*χ(ʷ)V\i (or \I*χˊ(ʷ)V\i, \I*χI(ʷ)V\i ) 'wild plum' opposed to \I*pǝqʷV\i plum. This root (but not Abkh. \Ia-pħʷaˊ,\i pace Lomtatidze 1961, 116-117) could be compared to PL \I*χʷen:\i 'plum, wild plum' (Lezg. \Iχʷat,\i dial. \Iχʷad,\i Tab. \Iχut,\i dial. \Iχud,\i Ag. \Iχut,\i dial. \Iχur,\i \Iχud,\i  Rut. \Iχäd,\i Tsakh. \Iχon,\i Kryz. \Iχed,\i Bud. \Iχed\i).

Again, pace Shagirov ibid., since the correspondence between Abkh. and Ad. here is quite obvious, it is impossible to connect the second part of the compound with PAK \I*bzǝ\i 'to cut' (q.v.). Finally, since Ub. has a palatal zˊ, the Ub. form (again despite Shagirov ibid.) can not be regarded as an Adygh loanword. The correspondence between PAK \I*-bʒa,\i PAT \I*pǝza\i and Ub. \I-bzˊa\i is quite regular.

Kumakhov's etymology (1964,126) - PAK \I*b(ǝ)q:aˊwǝ\i from \I*p:q:ǝ\i 'corpus, skeleton' - seems dubious, first of all because of the Kab. form \Ibǝq:ow\i (there's no parallel form \I*bǝq:ǝ\i 'skeleton' in Kab.). Very dubious is the comparison with Ub. \IbǝqˀIʷ\i 'thick' (Shagirov 2, 47).     Since there is no Ub. cognate, it is impossible to determine whether the first vowel in PWC was nasalized or not. Somewhat unclear is the status of the PAK *-wǝ: it is either a suffix (in this case \I*bǝq:aˊwǝ\i < \I*bǝq:ʷaˊ-wǝ\i), or part of the root which has yielded labialisation in Abkh.

We should relate here also the Ub. reduplicated stem \Icˀʷacˀʷ-\i (\Icˀʷacˀʷǝˊ-n\i "cela fait mal", \Icˀʷacˀʷǝˊ\i "mal, douleur"). For the semantic shift "dirty" > "bad" cf.

Unacceptable is Dumeˊzil's (Dumeˊzil 1963) etymology of the PAK form as "hand" + "bad". The PAK form is rather a compound analogous to Ub., and the component ʡa here has nothing to do either with PAK \I*ʡa-cˀʷǝ\i "sweet" or with PAK \I*ʡa\i "hand".

In Abkh. it was lost, and in Abaz. stayed only within a compound with \I(a)la-\i 'light' (same as in \Ila-šara\i 'light', historically = "eye").     In PAK the root \I*pcˊV\i ( < \I*P-ʒˊʷǝ\i with devoicing) is used in compounds \I*pcˊǝ-ħa\i 'evening' (listed above) and \I*pcˊa-dǝ-\i 'morning, tomorrow' (Kab. \Ipsˊa-dej\i 'tomorrow', \Ipsˊa-dǝ-ǯǝz\i 'morning', Ad. \Ipčˊa-dǝžˊ\i 'morning'). Finally, in Ub. the root -ǯˊ is also used only in compounds: \Izʷapsǝˊ-ǯˊ\i 'evening' (with \Izʷapsǝˊ\i id.) and \Isʷǝ-ǯˊ\i '(morning) dawn' (with \Isʷǝ\i id.).

Ub. \Iχʷǝ\i (compared with PAK \I*χʷǝ\i by Abdokov 1973, 73) may be an Ad. loan (which is the idea of T. Esenč, see Vogt 1963, 209, and of Shagirov 1977,2,112), but may well also be genuinely related (the phonetic correspondences are quite regular).

External evidence suggests that it must have been a hushing affricate. Also both velar *kˀ or uvular *qˀ may be reconstructed (since in clusters with dental affricates the Adygh languages do not tolerate uvulars).
305|*šˊʷa|532|1 son 2 youth, young boy|||sˊā-wa 2|sˊā-wa 1||    PAK *sˊa-waˊ. We can discover the same root (with the original meaning "to bear") in Ad. \Isˊā-λ(a)\i 'placenta', \Iχʷǝ-sˊa-n\i 'childbirth fits'. PAK *sˊ regularly goes back to PWC *šˊʷ.

Reflected are variants \I*gˊa(r)gˊa\i and \I*gʷa(r)gʷa\i which are hard to separate from each other.  Since there are no AK or Ub. parallels, we can assume both *gˊ (*gˊʷ) and *kˊ: (*kˊ:ʷ) in PWC.

The form \Ičˊǝgʷǝˊ\i corresponds best to Abkh. \Ia-gʷǝˊžˊ\i (if we assume a rather common metathesis). In PWC we must reconstruct *čˊ: and either *gʷ or *k:ʷ.

However, we think that the PAT form is also a descendant of the same root. Indeed, PAT "hissing-hushing" consonants may go back to PWC palatalized+labialized dentals, thus \I*cˊǝgʷǝ\i may go back to \I*tˊʷǝk:ʷǝ,\i and, if we assume a metathesis (which is very usual in roots of this type with two stops), we may postulate two basic variants for early PWC:     a) \I*kˊ:atˀˊǝwǝ\i > \I*kˊ:atˀǝwǝ\i ( > PAK \I*k:at:ǝˊwǝ,\i Ub. \Igˊatˀǝˊ\i);     b) \I*kˊ:atˊǝwǝ\i > \I*kˊ:ʷatˊʷǝ\i (with regressive labialisation) > PAT \I*gʷǝcˊǝ\i > \I*cˊǝgʷǝ.\i [Abdokov (1983, 123) compares the Abkh. form with heterogeneous diminutives: Chech. \Icic-ig,\i Av. \Iic:i-ko\i 'cat, kitty'. This is certainly wrong  because of the obviously different morphological structure of EC forms.]     It is interesting to note that these two forms exactly match two variants reconstructed for PEC (\I*gǟtˀuj\i and \I*gǟtuj\i).

322|*t:aq:a|1143|cock|||ātāq:a|ādāq:a|taˊqa|    PAK \I*at:aq:aˊ.\i Ub. has t- instead of the expected d- under the influence of the Ad. form; a direct loan from Ad. is less probable.     Shagirov (1, 56) analyses the first part of the PAK form as \I*at:aˊ\i 'father', which is unacceptable because of external parallels and the obscure character of the component *-q:a (it is, however, possible that the prothesis *a- appeared in PAK under the influence of this root).

Shagirov (1977, 72) supposed that the Ad. word was borrowed from Ubykh, which is hardly credible (we do not know of other loans in this direction). His reason was that the Ub. word can be analysed as \IbIaga\i 'fox' + \Išʷǝ\i 'diminutive suffix', but the external evidence (cf. especially Abkh. \Iaˊ-šˇa-bga\i) shows that this is a folk etymology, and šʷǝ here is an independent root.

The components *-ħV in PAK and *-xǝ in PAT (\I*šʷara-xǝ\i) are unclear. They may represent originally independent roots (for PAK \I*ħV\i cf. PEC \I*wHɨ˘rχ_V\i 'mountain goat', for PAT \I*-xǝ\i cf. PEC \I*ɦānxV\i 'deer' q.v.), but since they are attested only in compounds and in different subbranches of WC, such etymologies at present seem too risky.     The roots for 'deer' (\I*šˊʷV\i) and 'hunt' (\I*šˊ:ʷa\i) are correctly separated by Shagirov (1977,2,149) in an argument with Dumeˊzil (1967,160; 1969, 112). Also correct is his separating of Abkh. \Ia-čaˊ\i 'female deer' and Ub. \Ižʷa\i 'deer' (see PWC \I*čˊʷa\i / \I*ǯˊʷa\i). However, his separating PAT \I*šʷVrV\i from PAK \I*sˊǝħVˊ\i is hardly justified (the Ub. form \Iλa-šʷaˊ\i is not even considered).

Shagirov (1977, 103) proposes for the Adygh form a loan from Turk. (\Ibilim\i 'knowledge'), but it seems absolutely unacceptable for semantic reasons.

This analysis is also not supported by another meaning of the word, "table fork" (in Ad., Mozdok dialect of Kab.). We can, however, suppose a secondary influence of the root \I*sa\i on the Kabardian form (one would regularly expect \I*ʒāʒa\i there).

381|*bVc:ʷV|1267|medlar|a-baˊčˇ||nā-pca (Shaps.)||brǝcʷ|    The Abkh. form is probably most archaic; not quite clear is the origin of nā- in Shaps. and -r- in Ub. (cf. also Abkh. Bzyb. \Ia-braˊčˇ\i). It is also possible that all the WC forms reflect an original form like \I*bVnc:ʷV\i or \I*bVmc:ʷV\i with exceptional preservation of the old medial nasal (cf. external evidence); in this case the Ad. form should be treated as a metathesis ( < \I*banca\i), and the forms with -r- - as a result of denasalisation (-n- > -r-). In any case, the coincidence in Adyghe between \Ināpca\i 'medlar' and \Ināpca\i 'eye-brow' is, of course, purely fortuitous.

Shagirov (1, 238-239) justly notices that Trubetzkoy (1930, 276) was wrong in separating the Abkh. and Ub. forms and relating them to different EC roots. The correspondence PAT *ħ : PAK *qʷ : Ub. χˊ points regularly to PWC *qˊʷ.     See Meˊszaˊros 1934, 378; Balkarov 1969, 177; Shagirov 1, 238-239.

Despite Vogt, Ub. \ImIa-šʷǝˊ\i for obvious semantic reasons can not be a diminutive from \ImIa\i "apple". More probably, the association with the diminutive -šʷǝ is secondary (although it could have been the reason for irregular devoicing *žʷǝ > šʷǝ). An indirect proof that this was the case is Georg. \Imažalo\i 'wild apple-tree', which could have been borrowed from a language like Proto-Ubykh (before the devoicing).
384|*qˀǝča|1272|peach|||q:ǝca|q:ǝca (dial.)||    PAK \I*q:ǝcaˊ.\i The PAK *q: can go back to PWC *qˀ, *q:, *qˀI or *q:I; the PAK *-c- - to *c, *cˊ or *č. Shagirov's etymology (\I*q:ǝ\i 'plum' + \I*cǝ\i 'hair', see Shagirov 1, 229-230) is hardly acceptable, especially in view of the EC evidence.     In the Adygh languages there is a constant interaction of two roots: \I*q:ǝca\i 'peach' and \I*pχʷǝ-\i 'plum' (see \I*pǝqʷV\i). The Shaps. dialect has always \Ipχʷǝ-\i (\Ipχʷǝca\i 'peach', \Ipχʷǝsˊʷtˀa\i 'plum'); other dialects tend to have \Iq:ǝ-\i (cf. Ad. \Iq:ǝca\i 'peach', \Iq:ǝpˀcˀa\i 'plum').

Shagirov (1,91) tries to explain it as an instrumental morpheme, thus treating PAK \I*bžˊǝnǝˊ\i as 'smth. to be fried'. However, this *-nǝ is certainly absent in the Ub. and PAT word for 'garlic' (Ub. \Ižʷaˊšʷa,\i PAT \I*ǯǝšǝ\i), and may have been originally just an optional connecting morpheme (possibly an original obl. base marker).

433|*ba[q:I]V|1436|1 shed, cattle-shed 2 fortress, castle|a-bāˊ 2|||baq 1||    The Abkh. form presupposes PAT \I*baʕa\i (\I*bǝʕa\i), where -ʕ- < PWC *-q:I-. In Kab. one would rather expect -q: and not -q (a regular PAK match for PAT \I*baʕa\i would be \I*baq:V\i). This form must have indeed existed and is reflected in the Abaz. loan from Kabardian - \Ibaqˀ\i 'cattle-shed' (where qˀ is a regular Abaz. substitute for Kab. q: in loanwords). The reason for weakening -q: > -q in modern Kabardian is not quite clear. From the semantic point of view the correlation "cattle-shed" : "fortress" is not surprising, because it is known that towers/fortresses were used for keeping cattle.     Armenian \Ibak\i 'sheep-fold, enclosure' is probably of Caucasian origin, see Acharyan 1, 907 (although it may be borrowed also from Georg. \Ibakˀi\i 'fence, enclosure' - which, for phonetic reasons, can not be compared with WC forms - despite Kuipers 1960, 83, Shagirov 1, 73).

The seemingly obvious relationship of PAK \I*čˊa\i and Ub. \Ičˊa\i 'milk' is actually somewhat more complicated. A regular Ubykh reflex of PWC \I*ƛǝ\i would be \Išˊa;\i that is why the Ub. \Ičˊa\i matches not this root, but rather PAT \I*čˊǝ\i 'udder' (q.v.). The meaning of Ub. \Ičˊa\i could have been influenced by Adygh forms. Abdokov (1983, 134-135) prefers to reconstruct WC \I*čˊa\i while comparing PAK \I*čˊa\i 'milk' with Abaz. (Ashkh.) \Ičˊata,\i Abkh. \Ia-χ-čˀˊaˊt\i 'sour  cream, cream' ( = PAK \I*čˊata\i > Ad. \Išˊāta,\i Kab. \Išāta\i id.)., cf. also Ub. \Ičˊātaˊ\i  id. It is, however, most probable that all AT forms and the Ub. form are later loanwords from Adygh (see Shagirov 2, 136 with literature).     PAT \I*xǝ-šǝ\i 'milk' is an exact match for PAK \I*čˊǝ-xʷǝ\i ( > Kab. \Išxʷǝ;\i also  with metathesis \I*čˊxǝwǝ\i > Ad. \Išˊxǝwǝ\i) 'sour milk', going back to a PWC  compound \I*ƛǝ-λʷǝ\i 'white milk' (see Shagirov 2, 140); which is why Abdokov's  separate comparison of PAK \I*-xʷǝ\i in this compound with Av. \Irax\i is unacceptable.

Since the EC counterpart of the root means both 'sour' and 'raw' (a natural and frequent semantic correlation), it seems possible to compare also (with a secondary loss of initial labial) PAK \I*cˀǝ-naˊ\i (Ad., Kab. \Icˀǝna\i) 'raw' (also borrowed in Ub.: \Icˀǝna\i id., see Shagirov 2, 126).

In Ub. \Iwǝ-sʷaˊ\i 'metal' + 'white' = 'copper, bronze' : \Iwǝ-cˀʷaˊ\i 'metal' + '?' = 'iron'. If we assume that the Ub. and AK words for 'iron' are genetically related (certainly, the theory of Ub. \Iwǝcˀʷaˊ\i being an Adygh loanword, see Shagirov 1, 140, can not be considered seriously), the correspondence PAK *čˀ : Ub. cˀʷ is unambiguously pointing to the PWC lateral labialised *ƛˀʷ, for which the expected PAT correspondence is *cˀʷ - and we find it in PAT \I*ja-cˀʷa\i 'blue'.     The concept of iron being a "blue metal" is by no means strange: it goes back to one of the earliest varieties of tempered iron (steel), which was in Greek called \Ikuˊanos\i (cyan) and was dark-blue in colour (on the etymology of this word and the related Hitt. \Ikuwanna-\i see under \I*kwɨˉwV\i). We must also mention the widespread Caucasian myth about the birth of the cultural hero from a blue stone - which metaphorically depicts the ritual of tempering iron (see in greater detail Ardzinba 1985).     In view of all this the theory of Yakovlev (1941, 140-141), Shagirov (1,  140-141) who tried to explain PAK \I*ʁʷǝčˀǝˊ\i as "dried (\Iʁʷǝ-\i) earth (\Ičˀǝ\i)" must be obviously taken as a folk etymology. Far more right was Abdokov (1973, 48) who thought the AK and Ubykh words genetically related and explained \I*ʁʷǝ-\i as "metal" and \I*-čˀǝ\i as a colour-name. He proposed to consider the second part as "grey", not specifying, however, what particular root he had in mind (thus invoking Shagirov's criticism). Shagirov is right, indeed, that PAK \I*čˀˊǝxʷǝ\i 'light-blue, pale' (Ad. \Ičˀˊǝfǝ,\i Kab. \Isˊ˔ǝxʷ\i) can not be involved (it has čˀˊ, not čˀ). For Ubykh Abdokov probably meant the root present in Ub. \Icʷa-baˊ\i 'greyish' - which is actually possible (note a quite analogous variation cˀʷ / cʷ in the Ub. reflexes of PWC \I*ƛˀʷV\i 'earth' q.v.).     There is more to be said about the hypothetical PWC \I*ʁˊIʷǝƛˀʷV\i 'iron'. Since several authors relate the Hatti language to WC (see, e.g., Ivanov 1985), it seems very tempting to relate \I*ʁˊIʷǝƛˀʷV\i to the attested Hatti name for 'iron', \Iχap/walki\i (with χVw- rendering *ʁˊIʷ- and -lk- rendering the lateral -ƛˀ-), borrowed in Hurrian as \Iχabalgi,\i and further - Greek \Ikhalkoˊ-s,\i Balto-Slav. \I*gelegˊ-\i etc. (see Starostin 1985).

All these data leave no doubt in the existence of a separate PWC root \I*c:ʷa\i 'plough'. Shagirov (1, 104-105) is quite right in distinguishing this root from PWC \I*c:ʷǝ\i 'ox'; however, his proposal to consider it the same morpheme as \I*zʷa\i 'to plough' (q.v.) can not be accepted - all languages clearly distinguish these two roots phonetically.

Initial n- in the PAK form may be due to fronting assimilation (before a dental -z-).     The correspondence PAT *ʒˊ : PAK *z points to PWC *ʒˊ or *ǯ; the former is preferable in view of the external evidence.
543|*lˊV|1731|cubit|ra-kˀ|||||    The Abkh. form contains a singulative suffix -kˀ, thus the pure root is ra-.

We consider, however, the direct comparison of PAK \I*jǝ-zǝ\i (jǝ- is a usual pronominal prefix) with PAT \I*ʒˊa\i and Ub. \Iʒa\i 'span' more justified semantically, and quite regular phonetically - thus, the coincidence with \I*jǝˊzǝ\i 'full' is certainly secondary.     See Shagirov 1, 90; Klimov 1967, 306; Balkarov 1967, 15, 24.

In PAK *čˊ:- would be expected, but only the Kab. form is known (Kab. ž can go back to PAK *čˊ:, *č:, *ǯˊ). Still, the exact parallelism between Kab. \Ižǝʡa-\i and Ub. \Ičǝqˀa-\i (where the second part goes back to \I*qˀˊIa-\i 'say' q.v.) makes this etymology quite plausible.     The comparison of Kab. \Ižǝ-ʡa-\i and Abkh. \Iaˊžˇa\i was first proposed by Meˊszaros (1934, 308), who also compared Ub. \Imasˊa\i 'word' which is impossible for phonetic reasons.

Shagirov 1, 288 supposes that the Ub. form is borrowed from Adygh (PAK \I*nǝsaˊ-ʁʷǝ\i 'sister-in-law'); but this supposition does not explain loss of labialisation in Ub. It seems more probable that the Ub. and AK forms are genetically related.

Semantically and phonetically the forms are very close, and the correspondence PAT *ɣˊ : PāK *ɣ : Ub. ʁ points to the PWC palatalised lateral *Łˊ. Therefore Shagirov's explanation of the Adygh form as \I*pa\i 'nose' + \I*bɣǝ\i 'mountain' is hardly acceptable (although an analogy with \I*pa\i 'nose' is possible).

PAK \I*pˀcˀˊǝ\i can only go back to PWC \I*P-cˀˊʷǝ\i (a form which obviously corresponds to EC, see Trubetzkoy 1930, 82). The Ubykh form can go back to a voiced variant \I*zˊʷǝ;\i but the PAT form needs a more complicated explanation, if it belongs here at all: it may also reflect a secondarily voiced PWC variant \I*(b)-ʒˊʷV\i > PAT \I*ža,\i with labialisation under the influence of PAT \I*zʷǝ\i 'nine' (\I*ža\i > \I*žʷa\i ).         The hypothesis of uniting all three forms (PAT, PAK and Ub.) belongs to Abdokov (1973, 66). One can either accept it (with the complicated explanation presented above), or else separate the Ub. and Abkh. forms under a distinct protoform, PWC \I*žˊʷV\i (since *žˊʷ regularly gives PAT *žʷ and Ub. žʷ). However, Shagirov's attempt to unite Abkh. \Ižˇ-ba\i 'nine' and \Ižˇa-ba\i 'ten' (Shagirov 1, 80-81) is certainly untenable: in the Bzyb. dialect they are opposed as \Izˊˇ-ba\i vs. \Ižˇ-ba\i and go back to different PAT forms (\I*zʷǝ\i and \I*žʷa\i respectively).

For phonetic reasons the comparison of PAK \I*č:a-\i and Ub. \I-čˊa-\i (pointing to PWC \I*čˊ:ʷa-\i) is preferable to other comparisons: PAK \I*č:a-\i and Ub. \Ižaja\i 'swift' (Meˊszaˊros 1934, 326); PAK \I*č:a-\i and PAT \I*cˊa-\i 'to go' (Shagirov 1, 193).

Since, despite Dumeˊzil (1932, 107-108), PAK *t can not correspond to Ub. sˊ, we have to admit that the meaning 'to lift, raise' is here expressed by the component PAK \I*ʡa-,\i Ub. \Iqˀa-\i < PWC \I*qˊ:Ia-\i (or \I*qˀˊIa-\i), which must be therefore distinguished from the homonymous PWC root for 'hand' (q.v.).

The PAT form \I*čˊčˊa\i can be easily explained as a result of assimilation < \I*šǝčˊa\i (where *š < *λˊʷ and *čˊ < *čˊ). Therefore the commonly accepted comparison of Abkh. \I-čˊčˊa-\i with PK \I*cc-\i 'to laugh' (Charaya 1912, 48, Shagirov ibid etc.) seems rather superficial. If PWC \I*λˊʷV-čˊV-\i (\I*čˊV-λˊʷV\i) is a compound verb, only its component \I*čˊV\i can be compared with Kartvelian (we should add that both forms are probably onomatopeic in origin); the component \I*λˊʷV\i is certainly related to EC forms meaning 'to laugh'.

The PAT form can be related to Ubykh if we assume a metathesis (\I*kˀamǝsˊǝ\i < \I*sˊVmVkˀV\i) and assimilative / dissimilative processes - which is not surprising in an expressive root like this (cf., e.g., numerous irregularities in the IE root for 'ant' - \I*morm-\i / \I*morw-\i / \I*bhorm-\i etc.).

Since, however, PAT \I*mǝza\i and Ub. \Imǝʒaˊ\i 'candle, light' certainly constitute a different root (obviously having nothing to do with \I*bǝzˊa\i 'tongue'), it seems probable that in PAK the two different PWC roots had merged (phonetically this is quite regular).

(Abdokov gives also the meaning 'spend some time',  whereas the Kab.-Russ. dictonary only gives the gloss 'to graze (at night, of horses, oxen etc.)'. Adyghe reflects only the compound \I*pšˊǝ-pˀqˀa\i 'place of temporary abode', 'hut' (borrowed in Ub. as \Ipšˊǝpˀqˀaˊ\i 'lieu d'assembleˊe en plein air'); cf. also another derivate in Kab. \Ipsˊǝ-ʡa\i 'hut'.     See Abdokov 1983, 128-129 with the correct AT-AK comparison (the author  quotes also an Ub. verb \Ipšˊǝ-\i 'to abide, stay temporarily' - which we were  unable to identify and which is probably faulty: in Ub. we should regularly  expect a form like \Ipsˊǝ-\i). Because of the obvious AT cognate, Shagirov's  identification of the present root with PWC \I*pǝλ:ʷa\i 'to blow' (q.v.) should  certainly be rejected.

709|*sǝ|2006|wood, timber|||||sǝ|    Ub. def. \Iaˊ-s.\i Further connections of this word within WC are not quite  clear. Shagirov (1972, 137; 2, 60) and Abdokov (1983, 132) find a cognate in  Abkh., Abaz. \I-s(ǝ)\i 'suffix denoting material' (Abaz. \Iqǝlpa\i 'hat', \Iqǝlpa-s\i  'stuff for making hats' etc.) - on the analogy with a synonymous Adygh  morpheme \I-pχa\i going back to a root meaning 'wood'.     A probable derivate in Ub. is \Isǝ-χǝˊ\i 'horizontal bar, bolt, pole' (from  \Isǝ-\i 'wood' + \I-χǝ\i 'a possessive particle'). If this derivation is true, we must  admit an interesting fact of the further expansion of this term throughout the  Caucasus: to Adygh languages (Ad. \Isax\i 'bolt', Kab. \Isax\i 'post,pole'), whence Abkh. \Ia-saˊkˊ\i 'bolt', Abaz. (Ashkh.) \Isakˊ\i 'a pole for locking the gate',  and further - Osset. \Isäux\i 'post, pole' and Avar \Is:ak\i 'bridge support,  abutment'. See Shagirov 2, 60.
