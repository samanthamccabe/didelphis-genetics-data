If we assume that the Ub. and AK words for 'iron' are genetically related (certainly, the theory of Ub. \IwÉ™cÌ£Ê·Ã¡\i being an Adygh loanword, see Shagirov 1, 140, can not be considered seriously), the correspondence PAK *ÄÌ£ : Ub. cÌ£Ê· is unambiguously pointing to the PWC lateral labialised *Æ›Ì£Ê·, for which the expected PAT correspondence is *cÌ£Ê· - and we find it in PAT \I*ja-cÌ£Ê·a\i 'blue'. Â§    The concept of iron being a "blue metal" is by no means strange: it goes back to one of the earliest varieties of tempered iron (steel), which was in Greek called \IkÃºanos\i (cyan) and was dark-blue in colour (on the etymology of this word and the related Hitt. \Ikuwanna-\i see under \I*kwÉ¨Ì„wV\i). We must also mention the widespread Caucasian myth about the birth of the cultural hero from a blue stone - which metaphorically depicts the ritual of tempering iron (see in greater detail Ardzinba 1985). Â§    In view of all this the theory of Yakovlev (1941, 140-141), Shagirov (1,  140-141) who tried to explain PAK \I*ÊÊ·É™ÄÌ£É™Ì\i as "dried (\IÊÊ·É™-\i) earth (\IÄÌ£É™\i)" must be obviously taken as a folk etymology. Far more right was Abdokov (1973, 48) who thought the AK and Ubykh words genetically related and explained \I*ÊÊ·É™-\i as "metal" and \I*-ÄÌ£É™\i as a colour-name. He proposed to consider the second part as "grey", not specifying, however, what particular root he had in mind (thus invoking Shagirov's criticism). Shagirov is right, indeed, that PAK \I*ÄÌ£ÌÉ™xÊ·É™\i 'light-blue, pale' (Ad. \IÄÌ£ÌÉ™fÉ™,\i Kab. \IÅ›Ì£É™xÊ·\i) can not be involved (it has ÄÌ£Ì, not ÄÌ£). For Ubykh Abdokov probably meant the root present in Ub. \IcÊ·a-bÃ¡\i 'greyish' - which is actually possible (note a quite analogous variation cÌ£Ê· / cÊ· in the Ub. reflexes of PWC \I*Æ›Ì£Ê·V\i 'earth' q.v.). Â§    There is more to be said about the hypothetical PWC \I*ÊÌIÊ·É™Æ›Ì£Ê·V\i 'iron'. Since several authors relate the Hatti language to WC (see, e.g., Ivanov 1985), it seems very tempting to relate \I*ÊÌIÊ·É™Æ›Ì£Ê·V\i to the attested Hatti name for 'iron', \IÏ‡ap/walki\i (with Ï‡Vw- rendering *ÊÌIÊ·- and -lk- rendering the lateral -Æ›Ì£-), borrowed in Hurrian as \IÏ‡abalgi,\i and further - Greek \IkhalkÃ³-s,\i Balto-Slav. \I*geleÇµ-\i etc. (see Starostin 1985)."

Therefore the commonly accepted comparison of Abkh. \I-ÄÌÄÌa-\i with PK \I*cc-\i 'to laugh' (Charaya 1912, 48, Shagirov ibid etc.) seems rather superficial.
