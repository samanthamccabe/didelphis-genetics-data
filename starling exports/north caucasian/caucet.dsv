2|*Hrimq̲̇wV̆|0|ashes, soot||0||0||0|ḳa|305||0|*riq̇I:ʷ|4|zäḳ|1||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. Lak. \Iḳa\i ( = \Iḳʷa\i) is a regular reduction < \I*mVḳʷa\i which is a normal structural correspondence for the PL and Khin. forms (the PEC structure *HRVNCV̆). A very similar word is attested in Akhvakh (\Iraq̇ʷa\i 'soot'), but its phonetic structure and the reflex of *q̲̇w is  irregular. Is it possible to think of a loanword (Akhv. < Lezg.)?
3|*gɨ[r]ʒˊwV|0|noodles|*garʒa ( ˜ -ā-,-c̣-)|333||0||0||0||0|*č:uk:ala /*k:uč:ala|5||0||0|    A Nakh-Lezg. isogloss. Since the meaning coincides precisely in Nakh and some Lezg. languages (Bud.), we think that the comparison is valid and the original meaning was 'noodles', or at least some kind of food rising to the surface after boiling; hence the meaning 'sour cream' (usually connected with 'top', 'surface') in Tsakh., and the later development > 'bark' in other Lezg. languages.     The PL form has a suffix *-la; medial *-r- was probably lost as a result of dissimilation.

Some doubts are raised by the Lak. form - regularly \I*č̣aIq-\i would be expected; maybe pharyngealised *qI was lost in clusters with following class markers (real Lak. forms are \Ič̣aIwu-\i 1/3, \Ič̣aIru-\i 2/4 < \I*č̣aIq-bu-,\i \I*č̣aIq-ru-\i ?).         The PA form suggests that this root could have prefixed class markers in PEC; however, they are absent in all other languages (even in Av.) and may be in this case a PA innovation.

The root was obviously denoting a small bird in PNC; the shift to "eagle" in PD is a result of development "small bird" > "bird (in general)" (as in some Lezg. languages) > "bird par excellence" = "eagle". In any case the Darg. form is impossible to separate from this root.

There are certain phonetic irregularities (assimilation *ǯ- > *č̣- in PA and PC, with following dissimilation \I*č̣eq̇\i > \Ič̣eq\i in Gunz., absence of velarisation *q̇ʷ > ḳ in PA) which must be explained by the expressive nature of the root.

(in the original *HCVCV structure). Since the stem has no class prefixes in PN, Av. and PL, the PA situation is probably secondary (the expected stem \I*č̣Vr-\i or \I*Hič̣Vr-\i began to have an adjectival inflection).
12|*ḳărV|316|black; coal|*ḳaru|335||0||0|ḳalaš|309||0|*ḳarɨ-|14||0|*ḳǝ|280|    There is a good correspondence between the PN, PL and PAK forms. If we take into account the meaning 'coal' in PN and in the PL compound, this etymology of the Lak. form also becomes rather probable. Lak. ḳalaš must be a modification < *ḳa-š:al < *ḳar-š:al, where the second component is most probably PEC \I*č̲Häɫu\i 'sand, gravel' q.v. (normally reflected in Lak. as \Iš:aIlu\i).         Abdokov (1983, 94) compares the Adygh forms with EC descendants of  \I*ḳ̲wɨ̆nħV\i 'smoke' (q.v.), which seems less probable for phonetic reasons.

Since PD *b- in this case can not correspond to m- in other languages, we have to assume a metathesis *buḳumV < *muḳu-bV (probably with a former plural suffix). For the meaning "wind" in Darg. cf. 'cold wind, wind' in some Lezg. languages.

The vocalic reconstruction is not quite certain because of reduction in PN (in a suffixed derivate) and pharyngealization. The EC-WC comparison seems both phonetically and semantically reasonable. See Абдоков 1983, 175.

One is tempted to compare also PN \I*ʁo-,\i the present (durative) stem from \I*-aχ-\i 'to go', but this raises phonetic problems.          The PC and Av. forms (as well as PL Ablaut grade \I*ʔoqI:ʷä-\i) reflect a PEC Ablaut grade \I*-HumG̲wV;\i in Av. the root is reduplicated.

See Абдоков 1983, 165.    Some Lezghian languages reflect a derivate \I*ʔiƛ̣i-n\i > \I*ƛ̣in\i meaning 'oath' (cf. Lezg. \Iq̇in,\i Tsakh. \Iḳin\i). It seems thus quite proper to compare HU forms: Hurr. \Iel(a)mǝ\i 'oath', Urart. \Ielm-u/ošǝ\i 'vow' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 33).

It is not yet clear what should be reconstructed in these cases: perhaps, some cluster like *χl- or *lχ-. It is also possible that in some cases PAT l- is a result of secondary lateralisation, and Ub. w : PAK *ħ could also point to PWC *χˊIʷ (for which otherwise no examples are found).     Most of the EC languages point to the PEC oblique base *χ̲Hwĕj-rV- (cf. PN *pħare-, PA *χʷor-, PD *χ:ur-, PL *χ:ʷäjrV-); in some languages (Shakhdagh, Khin.) the former oblique base became direct.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 277, Abdokov 1983, 123.
27|*ʔuq̲wV (~-ō-)|424|to drink||0||0|*χ:i-ƛʷ-|164||0||0|*ʔoqʷa-|29||0||0|    A Tsez-Lezg. isogloss (but cf. also \I*=VqV\i 'to suck' which is sometimes hard to keep distinct).

The consonant *-q- gives more or less regular reflexes (with some variation in Aand.); however, the root vowel is quite impossible to reconstruct. This is due to the expressive nature of the root and, perhaps, to a partial contamination with PEC *ʔuq̲wV q.v.

Cf. also the nominal derivate \I*r-iG̲wV\i / \I*G̲wVrV\i 'draught' (PD \I*deʁʷ\i > Ak. \Ideʁ,\i Chir. \Ideʁʷ,\i Ur. \Idiw,\i PTs > Gunz. (Nakh.) \Iqor\i). Note a frequent use of the reduplicated stem \I*G̲wiGwVr-\i (in PA, PC, Lak.). See Абдоков 1983, 144-145.

In Darg. the root is preserved only within the derivate *ʕʷan-c̣(a) 'deaf' ( = "earless", with the privative suffix -c̣(a)). In PA and PC the root obtained suffixes (resp. *-di and *-χa); although their meaning is not quite clear, there is no doubt that the roots are comparable.

The meaning 'man' changed to ethnonym 'Laki' in Lak. (typologically a frequent phenomenon).     This root may have something to do with the PN and PAA words for 'slave' (if we assume that a self-denomination for Eastern Daghestan dwellers \I*lak:(V)\i could be borrowed by the Nakh and through them, possibly, by Western Caucasians with the meaning 'slave'): PN \I*lag\i (Chech., Ing. \Ilaj,\i Bacb. \Ilag\i), PAA \I*lǝgǝ\i (Abkh. \Ia-lǝˊg,\i Abaz. \Ilǝg\i). Since these words have a velar, they can not be connected with another EC name for 'slave', Av. \Ilaʁ\i etc. (see on its possible origin under \I*ʔV̄ƛ̣V\i).     Of obvious Caucasian origin is Osset. \Iläg\i 'man, male' (see Abayev 1973, 20).

The PWC form has a prefixed *ma- of somewhat obscure origin; the labialisation of *c̣ʷ must be explained either by the labialising influence of *m- or by the former oblique base vocalism *-ŭ- (suggested by PL obl. base \I*c̣ojɨ-\i / \I*c̣a(j)-rV-\i). See  Trubetzkoy 1930, 276; Abdokov 1983, 98.     Many languages reflect an old oblique base formed with the *-rV suffix (\I*c̣aj-rV-\i), cf. PN \I*c̣ari-,\i PA \I*c̣ari-\i (reflected in Akhv. \Ič̣ari\i), Lak. \I*c̣ara-,\i PL \I*c̣a(j)-rV-.\i The same stem with reduplication is probably reflected in PL \I*c̣arc̣ar\i 'luster, glitter' (Tab., Lezg. \Ic̣arc̣ar\i) exactly corresponding to PAT \I*cǝrǝcǝrǝ\i 'to glitter' (Abkh. \Ia-cǝrcǝr-ra,\i Abaz. \Icǝrcǝr-ra\i) (with the same loss of glottalisation and absence of labialisation as in \I*mǝca\i 'fire').     Another old derivate of the same root is probably PNC \I*c̣aj-lV\i 'brilliance, lightning' reflected in PN \I*stēla\i (~*sṭ-) ( > Chech. \Istēla-ʕad\i 'rainbow', \Istēla-χäštig\i 'lightning', /Usl./ \Istēla\i 'thunder', Ing. \Isela-ʕad\i 'rainbow'), Lak. \Ic̣aj\i 'brilliance, glitter', PD \I*c̣ala\i (Ak. \Ic̣ala\i 'sparkle', Chir. \Ic̣ala-laIm\i 'lightning') and PAK \I*c̣ǝ-wǝ-\i (with a verbal stem \I*-wǝ-\i) 'to shine, glitter' (Ad. Bzhed. \Ic̣ǝ-wǝ-,\i Kab. \Ic̣ǝ-wǝ-\i). Note that *-j, having passed to word-medial position in PN, has caused the shift *c̣- > *st- (*sṭ-); note also the absence of labialisation in PAK *c̣ (without the prefixed *mV-).

The PD (\I*dulk:ʷa\i < \I*duluk:a\i) and PL form point to the PEC structure *HRVCV̄; this should have given *HVRCV (in this case, \I*HulŁV\i) in Avaro-Ando-Cezian languages. However,the root was preserved only within a compound with \I*kwīlʡɨ'hand',\i and the first syllable was reduced both in Avaro-Andian and Cezian languages. In general, the comparison seems quite plausible.

It is usually accompanied by class prefixes; however, comparing PL \I*hIac̣ɨ-\i and the Av.

The verb usually is used with class prefixes; however, a prefixless stem \I*ʔĭŁ̲V-\i can also be reconstructed (reflected, with loss of the first syllable, in the PN imperative stem \I*lo,\i Av. stem II \Iƛ̣:e-,\i PD stem \I*k:V-\i). The Ablaut stem \I*-uŁ̲V\i is reflected in PL \I*ʔoƛ:ɨ-,\i Lak. \I=u=lu-\i and in some Darg. forms (if we reconstruct here *ū, PTs \I*-ɨƛ-\i may also reflect this stem - vs. \I*-iƛ-\i < \I*-ĭŁV\i). Finally, PN \I*t-ēλ-\i reflects another durative Ablaut stem (without secure parallels in other EC languages).     Cf. also Hurr., Urart. \Iar-\i 'to give' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 51).

Avar \Iṭul\i - if it belongs here, see above), in which case we can also compare Urart. \Izel-dǝ\i 'liver' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 48-49).     Abdokov's (1982, 83) attempt to compare this root with WC \I*c̣ʷA\i 'liver' should be regarded as unsuccessful (for phonetic reasons, and because of a better etymology for the WC form, q.v.).

By now it is hard to judge which situation is original; however, it seems probable that the initial syllable *Hā- is historically a prefix, and that we should reconstruct the most archaic form as \I*χuɫV\i (cf. the rather frequent reflex of this stem in different areas: in Av. /χ:alaˊ-ta-/, in PD /*χ:ʷala-/, in some Lezg. languages/Rut. χuläχ-dɨ, Tsakh. χɨli-na/.

The Khin. form raises some problems: it must be a metathesis (\Iḳʷar\i < \I*raḳʷ;\i the supposed form \I*raḳʷ\i would be a regular development < \I*rVq̲̇wV\i which must be a result of secondary labialisation < \I*rVmq̲̇V\i having occurred early in the history of the Khinalug language).     The EC and WC forms were compared in Trombetti 1923, Ломтатидзе 1955, Meˊszaroˊs 1934, Абдоков 1983. The comparison seems reasonable enough, but we must note that to justify it phonetically we must suppose a metathesis \I*Hrēmq̲̇ĭ\i > \I*Hmērq̲̇ĭ\i in early Proto-WC (otherwise *-m- would have been lost); it is even possible that the Adygh languages reflect the normal \I*Hrēmq̲̇ĭ\i (no nasal is preserved in PAK), while Ub. and PAT reflect the metathesized variant. Labialisation in PWC is probably assimilatory (after a labial consonant); palatalisation is regular.

It seems very probable that the same root serves as part of an old (PEC) compound which can be reconstructed as \I*dVHV-ʕwamħV.\i It means some small wild animal and can be traced in following languages:     a) PN \I*dʕaʡam\i 'badger', reflected in Chech. \Idaʕam\i (RCD \Idʕama\i), Lev. \Idaʕam,\i Itumk. \Idʕām,\i Ved. \Idʕaʕam,\i Shar. \Idʕām.\i     b) Av. \Iʕondoˊ-ƛ̣:\i 'weasel' = PA \I*handa-riƛ̣:u\i (Akhv.

Correspondences are regular except for the vowel in PL (we would rather expect \I*ħirč:ʷ\i or \I*ħärč:ʷ\i); however, we must note that in this root most Lezghian languages lost the initial syllable, thus the PL vocalic reconstruction is not very certain.     PL has also another root, PL \I*(j)ic̣:\i (Arch. \Iic̣,\i erg. \Iic̣:i,\i Rut. \Idɨn\i < \I*(j)ic̣:ɨ-n\i) "goat's wool".

Despite some authors (Dzhavakhishvili 1937,419, Bghazhba 1948,42, Klimov 1963,223) this root has nothing to do with the PNC  numeral "one" q.v.     The only apparent irregularity is the strength of *c: in PWC, while the PEC root  vowel is short. This is probably due to the early vowel contraction after the (regular) loss of resonant+laryngeal in PWC.

Since interaction of this kind between two neighbouring resonants is very frequent in Caucasian languages, we think that the etymology is rather probable.

In PWC *p(ǝ)- is a frequent nominal prefix. We should note also some phonetic irregularities: Khin. χ- instead of expected q- (probably under influence of Az. \Iχanɨm\i 'lady' /which has nothing to do with the root in question/ or related Lezghian forms; direct borrowing from Kryz or Az. is rather improbable in this case); PL \I*χon-p:V\i instead of expected \I*χʷen-p:V\i - probably, an early reduction in a polysyllabic pluralis tantum. Otherwise the correspondences are regular, and the reconstruction seems rather secure.

The Lak. form  has a pharyngealized vowel, which may reflect some lost laryngeal; but since other languages do not reflect it (see above about the secondary nature of pharyngealization in Tsakh.), it is probably new (expressive).

Inspite of this metathesis, the etymology seems quite reliable, both semantically and phonetically.     It is interesting to note that HU languages seem to reflect both \I*swĕrho\i 'year' ( > Hurr. šawalǝ, Urart. šālǝ id.) and the derivate \I*t-eswĕ(rho)-\i ( > PN \I*t-iši-\i), reflected in Hurr. \Itež-u/oɣǝ,\i \Ites:-oχ:ǝ\i 'elder, overseer', Urart. \Iteš-\i 'to ripen' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 25, 30).

A possible HU parallel is \I*-s(u)wa\i in Hurr. \Itar-ž(u)wa-nnǝ\i, Urart. \Itar-šua-nǝ\i 'man, human being' (where *tar- is probably connected with *tur- 'male', see *lɨwŁV); see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 39.

The original meaning must have been "to emit, pour" (whence, a) "to wash, to bathe", b) "to throw, strew; to leap", c) "to vomit" - meanings constantly recurring in different subgroups). It is interesting to note that many languages have prefixed *l- or suffixed *-l- ( < *ɫ). It may mean that *ɫ- was originally part of the root (\I*ɫǟwčĂ\i) and was later reinterpreted as a preverb.

The comparison seems quite plausible (see Абдоков 1983, 163; note also the existence of common EC and NC derivates meaning 'sheath, case' - see Абдоков 1983, 130). The final *-w has left traces in PA (\I*r-iƛobV\i), Lak. (Proto.-Lak. \I*λob(i)\i > Arch. \Iλob\i) and PL (as labialisation of *-λ:ʷ-). In some languages, because of similar reflexes of *ƛ and *x, the root tends to be confused with PNC \I*-exE\i (q.v.), but they are opposed in several subgroups, and should be strictly distinguished.

There are no certain traces of this root in PTs; cf. perhaps Tsez. \Iiχ-ju\i 'thick'.

The initial laryngeal can be reconstructed on basis of Av., Lak. and PTs data; it tends to be replaced by class markers (when the root is functioning as a verb), and in PN the weak syllable with the laryngeal was lost altogether.     In some cases it is hard to distinguish between reflexes of \I*ɦĭfV\i 'to guard, graze' and \I*HŭqwV\i 'to preserve, take care of'(q.v.)

The first (weak) syllable with the initial laryngeal was dropped in Av., Lak. and Khin. (and, of course, in PWC where it is the normal reflex), but is preserved in PD and PL. Medial -r- in PD does not represent the original *-n- (which was probably dropped); it is rather a trace of an oblique stem *ʔurči < *ʔuč-ri-.     One of the most secure common NC roots.

[It is interesting to note Cham. \Itaguma\i 'bow': it could go back to PA \I*ta(r\i)gu-ma ( ~ -o-), and thus belong to the same root.

The Laki form lis:u reflects a regular dropping of initial *mV- (\Ilis:u\i < \I*mVlis:u,\i the latter being a metathesized form of \I*mV(r\i)s:i-lu).     The WC forms are very likely to belong here, too, although problems are raised by initial *p:- (we should expect \I*bǝsa\i); it may be a result of irregular dissimilative development within the PWC compound \I**bǝ˜la-bǝsa.\i

Although all the forms point to PEC *r-, this consonant may represent the old female class marker; in that case the root \I*-īlcˊ̲wī\i can be a result of usual adjectival metathesis < \I*(-ī)cˊ̲wīlV,\i and we could compare also HU forms: Hurr. \Išali,\i Ur. \Isǝlā\i 'daughter' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 42).

The original meaning must have been "edge, protruding end" preserved in PAA, whence "lip" (PTs) or "forehead" (PL); finally "end" > "game end, set" in PN.

Second, we should normally expect Lak. c:- or s:-; z- is a normal reflex of labialised *ʒw - however, no other language points here to any kind of labialisation. Perhaps the second component was *-k:ʷana (which would also account for lack of palatalisation k: > č: in literary Lak. and Khosr.) and there was an early assimilation \I*ʒa(l\i)-k:ʷana > \I*ʒʷa(l\i)-k:ʷana in Lak.? Any way, until the nature of the second component will be cleared, the question will remain open.

The correspondence PL *-t- : PD *-t:- can only occur in the combination with a preceding nasal (*-md-).

The word often serves as first part of compounds, see under \I*HɫuŁV̄,\i \I*xaɫV,\i \I*χĕɫHe.\i In some cases it is hard to establish the etymology of the compound's second element (because of contractions and irregular transformations): this is the case with Av.

Chir. \Ikuṭa\i 'mitten' (probably also < Lak.). Darg. preserves the root only within the compound \I*kʷi-leχ:a\i 'bracelet' (see under \I*lĕχ̲V\i).

He compares this set of EC forms with PWC \I*kʷǝ\i 'middle'. Since the only reliable EC data point clearly to \I*kīrV\i or \I*kērV,\i this etymology is to be rejected.

Abdokov (1983, 74) tries to relate here some WC  forms: Ub. \ILa\i 'intestine' (which belongs rather to WC \I*Lˊǝ\i 'meat, flesh') and  PAK *\I(b)La-\i 'chain' (in Kab. \ILa-rǝ-ps,\i Ad. \IbLa-rǝ-ps\i 'chain') - which reflects  rather the PAK verbal root \I*bLa-\i 'to thread on a string, to plait'.

In PWC the root has a frequent labial prefix (probably originally a class marker). In EC the original structure of the root was best preserved in Av.-And. and Nakh; in most other languages, where the root was treated mainly as an adjective, it obtained a productive adjectival (*participial) suffix *-rV and underwent metatheses, usual in cases like this: \I*Hăʒ̲ĔmV-rV-\i > \I*Hăʒ̲mĔ-rV-\i > \I*Hămʒ̲ĔrV-\i // \I*mHărʒ̲Ĕ-.\i Cf. also Hurr. \Išēɣ-(a)lǝ\i 'ritually pure', \Išēɣǝ,\i \Išīɣǝ\i 'pure (water)', Urart. \Išēχa\i id.

The original meaning was, perhaps, 'dark grey' or 'dark yellow' (in Lak. 'dark' > 'blind', which is a rather usual semantic development).

Phonetic correspondences are regular (except for the vowel -i- in PL, where one would rather expect -ä-; this is probably due to the PL Ablaut *ä/i).

The phonetic side of it is also quite regular (in PWC we should expect *L - a phoneme which lacks as such, and must have merged early with *Lˊ).         In WC languages the root is verbal, in EC - nominal; the only trace of its verbal usage is perhaps a Lak. form (recorded in the Khosrekh dialect) \I=u=k:a-n\i 'to paint'.         Abdokov (1983, 77) quotes also Kab. \ILa,\i \Iq:ʷǝ-La\i 'inner side of skin'  (which he compares with heterogeneous EC material, having nothing to do with  the present root); if it really exists (we could not find it in existing  dictionaries), it may be a remnant of \I*Ł̲ŏli\i with the meaning 'skin'.

The semantic correlation "bitter":"sweet" is quite common (cf. the various meanings of \I*sal-\i and its derivates in Indo-European), thus the WC-EC comparison seems quite satisfactory. Note the frequent appearance of reduplication in this root (in PD, PL, PWC); we can probably reconstruct a reduplicated variant \I*q̇ĕq̇ĕɦlV\i already for PNC.         In PTs the stem obtained prefixed class markers (\I*-Vq̇VlV\i) with further standard adjectival development > \I*-Vq̇lV\i > \I*-Vlq̇V\i > PTs \I*-ɨ˜q̇V\i (nasalisation is a normal reflex of medial resonants).

Consonantal correspondences are more or less regular (we should mention only the regressive assimilation in Av.-And.-Tsez. and the delabialisation of the dental stop in PWC: rather frequent phenomena in roots consisting of two stops). Note that Arch. \Ikūṭa-\i 'short' is obviously a Lak. loan.         Phonetically a perfect match is Khin. \Iḳuṭa\i 'puppy'; since it has no other etymology, it may ultimately belong here, too.         Both meanings - simply 'short' and 'short-eared (animal)' must be postulated already for PEC, since they keep appearing in different subgroups. However, it is hard to reconstruct a definite meaning for PNC (was it 'short' or a 'short-horned animal' or both?).

Since the root means 'male, man' in Nakh and Arch., it is natural to compare also the HU material: Ur. \Iwāšǝ\i 'men, people' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 20).     The labialisation in PA is secondary (Av. and all other languages clearly reflect *-š-), probably under the labialising influence of *w-.

Note a unique reflex *-wƛ̣- > *-ṗ- in PN, and the irregular development of *ƛ̣ in a tense word > *ƛ̣ in PL. The latter phenomenon is explained obviously by the influence of another NC root, \I*ɦemƛ̣V\i 'dream' q.v.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241.

The PN form \I*tuχe\i is interesting: it may be related here only if we assume the suffixed nature of *-χe (which is semantically not clear); but in any case the development \I*tuχe\i < \I*cwVn-χV\i within PN is proved by an early Ossetian loan: \Icäχχ\i / \Icänχä\i 'salt'.

The metathesizes form is probably reflected in HU: Hurr. šimī-gǝ 'sun' (with a diminutive suffix), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 23.     The inner analysis of the WC form (prefix *ma- + \I*λʷV\i 'white, light') which had been accepted by many authors (see Чарая 1912, 46; Яковлев 1948, 273, 292; 1941, 260; Rogava 1956, 26; Kuipers 1960, 111; Shagirov 1, 262) must be regarded as a folk etymology, because of the obvious relationship between the EC and WC forms.     Interesting is the comparison of the WC forms with Old Georgian \Isa-mχari\i 'south' (Чикобава 1953, 71); on the other hand, Meˊszaros' comparison of WC forms with PEC \I*Hwīq̲̇ī\i 'day' (1934, 242) is absolutely untenable.

The Urartian parallel makes a loan from Iranian improbable: thus Osset. \Inakä\i 'swimming' is probably a loan from Nakh, not vice versa (pace Abayev 1973, 152) and hardly goes back to \I*snāka-\i.

The EC-WC comparison was suggested by Shagirov (1977). There exist also interesting Kartvelian parallels: cf.

Untenable is Trubetzkoy's (1930) comparison of the WC root with Darg. \Igʷaza,\i Lak. \Ik:ʷac:a\i etc. 'mare'.        In Nakh languages, besides \I*psṭuw,\i there is a series of similar forms: Chech. \Istē\i 'woman; female' (pl. \Isteš,\i Usl. \Istij\i), \Istē-n\i 'female', Akk. \Isēwa˜\i 'female', Ing. \Ise\i id., pl. \Iistij\i ( = Chech. \Istij\i) 'women, wives'. There are two possible solutions: to consider these forms as derived from \I*psṭuw\i (from the oblique base \I*psṭawV-\i), or to compare them separately with an isolated Darg. form - Chir. \Icade\i 'female' (reconstructing PEC \I*cVjdV\i (~ cˊ-)).

Similar roots are known in Kartvelian (PK \I*ḳaḳal-\i 'nut', \I*ḳaḳa-\i  'fruit stone'); however, the supposition of a late loan of Lezg. forms from  Georg. \Iḳaḳali\i 'walnut' (Klimov 1972, 352) or from Arm. \Ik:ak:al\i id. (Klimov, Vinogradova 1979, 158) is unacceptable - both because Lezg. forms are very different semantically and because they fit well into the common NC root.

In PWC the specific cluster *ʔl- developped into *ƛ, with a regular strengthening before a long vowel; the resulting \I*ƛ:VλV\i (where -λ- regularly < *-ƛ-) developed into \I*ƛ:Vλ:V\i through assimilation. Although superficially the EC and WC forms are very different, they are no doubt genetically related.     Trubetzkoy (1922, 239) incorrectly compares the PA root with Lezg. \Ijif\i  (which in reality goes back to PEC \I*ɦnicˊ̲wV\i q.v.).

The WC evidence suggests that it may have been originally verbal ("to bear"), but in all modern languages it is used only as a noun. Phonetic correspondences are quite regular; the only problem is Lak. -s (-š would be expected normally). The seemingly classless forms (PC \I*ʔožǝ,\i Lak. \Iars,\i PD \I*ʔurši,\i Khin. \Iši\i) reflect the PEC form with the weak male class prefix \I*u̲=ɨšwĔ;\i the only form which can reflect an original prefixless stem is the PL plural \I*š:i-p:V\i ( < \I*šʷi-bV\i). In Lak., Darg. and Urart. the stem obtained a secondary medial -r- (no trace of it in any other language); it can not be a feminine class affix, because the word means only 'son, boy' in these languages. This -r- probably reflects an oblique stem with the *-rV suffix (\I*-ɨ̆šwĔ-rV-\i > \I*-ɨ̆ršwV\i).

This semantic opposition is rather obscured in Dargwa dialects, where the meanings are sometimes reversed, and sometimes organized in another way (e.g. in Chirag: \I-elχ:ʷ-\i 'to kill' vs. \I-elχʷ-\i 'to slaughter'), probably because of the intermixture of the two stems. WC languages have preserved only the "tense" stem, used only within compounds, thus it is difficult to formulate the precise meaning of the morpheme in PWC.

Other forms are less secure: we could find the Tsakh. and Khin. forms only in Khaidakov's somewhat unreliable word-list, and the Abkh. form is isolated within WC.

It should be noted that the Lak., PD (and possibly PL > Ag) forms reflect a variant with metathesized labialisation (\I*ʔār-c̣̲wämʔV̆\i > \I*ʔwār-c̣̲ämʔV̆\i ); in PL additionally the nasalisation was also shifted to the initial position. Quite irregular (and as yet unexplained) is -č̣- (instead of expected -c̣-) in PD (Chir.); however, there is no reason to suspect a borrowing. We should note also an interesting form: Cham. \Iercim\i 'kite'; since it is quite isolated within Av.-And., it must be an old Nakh borrowing (before the denasalisation *-mʔ- > -w-).

The word means uniformly 'ram', thus the meaning 'young goat' in PL (where the form has a suffixed, possibly originally plural, *-r) is secondary.

Both phonetically and semantically the EC-WC parallel seems quite plausible. PWC has a frequent labial prefix. In a position following a labial WC labialized consonants usually are delabialized, but not in this case (PAA *sˊ : PAK *sˊ point unambiguously to *sˊʷ; in Ubykh, in fact, delabialisation had occurred - otherwise we would have pšʷa- - but this is a regular later Ubykh process). Lack of delabialisation can be very well explained if we assume a form like \I*pǝ-sˊǝHwV\i > \I*pǝ-sˊǝwV\i (not \I*pǝ-sˊʷV\i) for the early period, when the after-labial delabialisation process was active. For phonetic reasons it seems better to keep apart WC \I*pǝsV\i 'soul' (which is superficially closer to PN \I*sa\i), which has a quite different NC etymology (see under \I*ʡăms̲a\i).

The correspondence is not quite regular: with a tense phonation we would rather expect \I*q̇ʷǝ-\i or \I*ʁʷǝ-\i in PWC. Perhaps we should reconstruct \I*-VḳwV,\i regularly yielding PWC \I*ḳʷǝ-\i and acquiring a secondary (expressive) tenseness in PA? At any rate, it is hard to separate the PA and PWC forms.

Otherwise the correspondences are regular (*-l- disappearing in cluster in Av. and yielding nasalisation in PTs). The PD form probably comes from \I*hepq̇ul(i\i) with reduction of the medial vowel and cluster simplification.     There are some doubts whether the WC form belongs here (in this case a usual delabialisation *-Gʷ- > *-G- after a labial should be assumed) or to another root (\I*panG̲VlhV\i 'leaf; bark' q.v.) - both possibilities should be considered.

Similar forms are spread in Kartvelian languages: Georg. \Iḳuč̣i\i 'intestines, stomach of birds', Svan. \Iḳvič̣\i 'bird's crop, craw'. A Kartvelian loan is Osset. \Igūc̣a\i "bird's crop; throat". See Bouda 1950, 294; Abayev 1958, 526 (he also links And. \Iʁʷaʁʷači\i "belly" which does not belong here); Shagirov 1, 217. However, Abayev's supposition about Iranian origin of Caucasian forms (cf.

The PN reflex \I*marš\i raises some doubts: we should regularly expect \I*barš.\i This, and the isolated position of the Chech. word, suggests a loan, possibly from some Av.-And. source (see comments on the PA form, suggesting the existence of some Av. dialectal form like \I*marš:u\i).

The PA form is metathesized (\Ireq̇eb-\i < \I*biq̇irV\i); it is interesting to note that the metathesis is exactly the same as in Akhv. \Iruc̣:u\i 'sheep-flock' < PA \I*bic̣:ʷirV.\i PN has lost the final -rV syllable; however, since it is a frequent suffix in animal names, we may conjecture also that PN preserves the original situation, while other languages reflect a suffixed form.         The root must have meant originally "young of a horned animal"; in PN the meaning has shifted to "young of an ungulate animal" > "foal".

Obviously an expressive (onomatopoeic) root. It must have originally referred to young horned animals (mostly sheep or goats), but in some languages has come to mean 'ram' or 'sheep' in general.     The darg. form (reflected only in the Kait. dialect) has an irregular m- - which is not surprising in a root of this kind.

In Darg. the form became metathesized (probably on analogy with \I*mac:a\i 'sheep' q.v.); otherwise the correspondences are quite regular. Relating the PAK root to Chech. \Ižij\i 'sheep', \Iža\i 'sheep-flock' (Dzhanashia 1959) is inacceptable.

812|*čwǝ̆rq̲ū (~ -l-)|0|sheep, lamb|*čuχV|228|*čVq:u|335||0||0|*čaq:a|183||0||0||0|    The root is, actually, an Avar-Nakh isogloss (the Darg. form may be borrowed). However, the correspondences seem to be regular and the PEC form can be reconstructed (although with some doubt). Neither PN nor Av. have Inlaut resonants here, but the presence of *-r- or *-l- is suggested by the correspondence -χ- : -q:- (without the resonant -q- would be preserved in PN).
813|*ɫVmbagV|0|sheep||0|*lVmbagV|336||0||0||0|*lamp:ak:|475||0||0|    The root is rather restricted geographically and has a peculiar shape (as well as non-standard reflexes of medial *-mb-), thus old borrowing is not excluded (however, the source is not clear).

Correspondences are normal; PTs reveals a usual reduction of the medial syllable with a resonant in a polysyllabic structure; unfortunately, there is not enough evidence to establish whether there had been nasalization in the PTs root (regularly it would have been expected).

In PTs the labialisation had passed to the Inlaut resonant (a rather frequent development). The Avaro-Andian forms contain a dental suffix. Therefore it is most probable that Lak. \Ič̣iṭ,\i Darg. (Ak.) \Ič̣iṭ\i 'bug' are borrowed from Avar (they correspond badly to other EC forms, but are well explained if we assume a loan).     There exists, however, another parallel in the Lak.-Darg. area: cf. Darg. Chir. \Ičaṭ\i 'grass-hopper', Lak. \Ič̣aṭi\i 'larva'. It is not excluded that these forms reflect the same suffixed form as Av. \Ič̣eṭ,\i i.e. PEC \I*č̣wɨ̆n-ṭV\i (\I*č̣ɨ̆m-ṭV\i).

Since we have to reconstruct -w- (to account for the reflex *-o- in PA, and possibly for *-e- in PC), we may conjecture that final *-ā passed to *-ū in Av. under influence of the medial -w-.

The medial nasal accounts for nasalization (*b- > m-) in PC, PL and Khin. After denasalization it has regularly passed into non-nasal -r-. Note, however, what has been said above about the PL form (a possible merger of two different roots there). [NB: the final version of the MSU recordings has \Imɨrs\i in Khin. If this - not the earlier \Imɨrc\i - is right, then the Khin. form should be considered as a loan from Shakhdagh.]

Most languages have suffixed forms either with original plural formants (PL *-or, perhaps also Khin. -äš; PC *-l- - note that in PGB a second plural formant *-ba has been added) or with less clear elements (PA *-tu, *-jiƛ:u). Correspondences are quite regular.

Within EC the root is preserved in the original shape only in Udi; in Avaro-Ando-Tsezian languages it had been actively contaminated with another PEC root for "beard", \I*bōlʒˊi\i q.v. (hence mi- in PA, cf. \I*miža,\i and *bü- (<*bi-) in PC, cf. \I*biša-l-\i). Moreover, as it is usual with roots of this structure (containing two stops), it was liable to metathesis, and it is now hard to establish which of the two variants is original.     The front vowel after *ʒˊ is reconstructed on basis of WC evidence (however, front *ḳˊ is there probably a secondary result of assimilation).

Nevertheless, the protoform can be more or less securely reconstructed. [For metathesized variants in WC cf. some similar EC forms: Gunz. \Iḳonč̣u\i 'tumour', Akhv. \Iq̇:ʷač̣a\i 'abscess'; there is, however, hardly enough evidence to reconstruct a separate root].

It is interesting to note that both in Chech. and in Inkh. the word (Chech. \Ihuma,\i Inkh. \Ihimon\i) also means "thing". In Chech. this is probably just a case of homonymy (\Ihuma\i 'thing' < PN \I*fu-ma\i is actually derived from an interrogative pronominal stem 'what'). The meaning of the word in Inkhokvari apparently reflects Nakh influence (and may be also affected by the presence of a similar interrogative stem - \Ihi-bo\i 'which').

The meaning 'drop' in some languages (Kar., Lak., Rut.) is probably a result of partial contamination with another similar PEC root, \I*ṭHänḳŏ\i q.v.     An EC source is probable for Georg. \Iḳwinṭali\i 'pimple', Osset. \Iḳʷɨdīlɨ\i / \Igudeli\i 'wart' (see Abayev 1958, 646-7: Osset.-Georg.).

An expressive root (although the relationship of Av.-And., Lak. and Ag. forms is obvious). The 1st syllable vowel is hard to reconstruct. In Lak. -k- (instead of -ḳ-) is either a result of secondary dissimilation, or of contamination with \Iṭink\i 'pimple, rash' (see \I*ṭimƛwV\i).

It is interesting to note the dialectal Lak. (Khosr.) form \Iṭinx\i 'pimple'; since literary Lak. has \Iṭink,\i the Khosr. form must be borrowed from some Lezgian source.

(probably \I*q̲̇HapE\i > \I*q̲̇HaṗE\i (assimilation) > \I*qebV-\i (the normal expected development in PTs) > \I*ʁebV-\i (assimilation in voicing)). Most languages, however, preserve the original structure with the first glottalized and the second voiceless stop.     Comparison of WC and EC (Lak., Darg.) data see Shagirov 1977, 2, 41.     Some EC languages have strange metathesized forms which seem to be later WC loans (?) (Kryz. \Ibäḳä\i 'a high cap', Bezht. \Ibaʔi\i 'hat, cap'). Immediate loans from Adygh languages are Svan. \Ipaq̇ʷ\i 'hat, cap', Balk. \Ibokka\i 'children's cap'.     Roots of the type *KAPV / *PAKV meaning 'cap' are widely spread in Eurasia, cf. forms quoted by Bouda (1960, 202) : Koryak \Ipenkel,\i Alyut. \Ipankal,\i Shugn. \Ipakōl\i 'cap, hat'; cf. also several late European forms: Lat. (late) \Icappa\i (whence Pol. \Ikapa\i > Rus. \Iкапа\i), Slav. \I*čepьсь,\i Lit. \Ikepuˋrē\i 'cap' (see Vasmer 2,183; 4,333). However, some phonetic features of the Caucasian material (glottalisation and pharyngealisation in the root, regular correspondences between languages) suggest that it still should be reconstructed for PNC.

In PL there occurred a usual assimilation (\I*č:at:\i < \I*čat:\i). For PNC we could also reconstruct *č- - if we would suppose that this assimilation occurred already in PEC (\I*čä̆dV\i > \I*ǯä̆dV\i): since the PTs form is reconstructed only on Gunz. and Bezht. evidence, it could contain either *š:- ( < PEC *cˊ-) or *ž- ( < PEC *ǯ-).

It is much more difficult to explain the PA form with *-ƛ- (or *-λ-) instead of the expected *-ƛ̣:-; reasons for deglottalisation are not at all clear.     The root has probable correspondences in HU: Hurr. \Ipōra-(m)mi,\i Ur. \Iporā\i "slave" (with a typologically frequent semantic shift and a regular development *-Ł- > -r-), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 16.

Not quite clear, though, is -r- in the PA form: \I*borto\i may go back to \I*bot(V)-ro\i with an original suffixation. It is interesting to note initial ħe- in the Av. form, corresponding to Arch. pharyngealization and speaking in favour of the initial cluster *Hp- in PNC.     Note also Chech. \Ibedar\i (Cheb. \Ibadir\i) "clothes" which is probably a loan from Western Daghestan languages (loss of *-d- would be regularly expected).

The Lak. form can also be a loan from Avar (especially considering its meaning), but the rest of the forms correspond to each other quite regularly and must be genuinely related.

In the Anlaut there occurs a variation *p-/b- (probably *p- > *ṗ- through assimilation and then again > *b- through dissimilation - a process typical for roots containing two stops).     The meaning 'hollow stalk, tube' in Lak. provides a necessary semantic link between 'vulva' in Western languages and 'penis' in Aghul; cf. also the meanings in Darg. dialects.

The Tsezian forms (Tsez. \Ibirus,\i Gunz. \Ibǝrus,\i Bezht. \Iboʔos,\i Khvarsh., Inkh. \Iburuc;\i note that Av. Chad. \Iburuˊš,\i because of its phonetic structure, is most probably a back-loan from Tsezian languages) are more or less recent loans from Av.-And. languages; the Av. word is also borrowed in Kum. \Ipurus.\i There is also a number of quite enigmatic forms: Bagv. Tlond. \Iperec̣:,\i Ud. \Ipenec:\i 'plough' which are probably also borrowed, but the source is not clear. We should also mention Lezg. \Ibazu\i "pole of the plough", obviously connected with Az. \Ibazɨ\i id., but without a certain etymology (cf. the WC forms).

Cf. also an interesting Lak-Darg. isogloss, pointing to a reconstruction \I*b(H)VldV\i: Lak. \Iburt:ij\i 'on horse-back', \Iburt:ijhu\i 'rider', PD \I*murt:a\i 'rider' (Ak. \Imurda,\i Chir. \Imart:a\i).         All the listed forms can be in fact old loanwords from Alanic (Scythian), cf. Scyth. \I*bālya-\i 'troup of horse riders', \I*bālti-\i 'horse ride' - reconstructed on basis of Osset. \Ibal,\i \Ibalc\i and going back to an Iranian verbal stem \I*bār-\i 'to mount, ride (on horse-back)'. Other reflexes of this verb in Ossetian are \Ibajrag\i 'foal, stallion' and \Ibaräg\i 'horse-rider' (whence a later Nakh loanword: Chech. \Ibērī,\i Ing. \Ibäri\i).

Abdokov (1983,  126) compares the EC root (including several unrelated Lezg. forms) with Kab.  \Iṗsˊ̣ā-nṭa\i 'yard'. This can be true (alternative etymologies of the Kab. word  - Kuipers 1960, 111 and Shagirov 2, 52 - are not convincing), if the first  part of the Kab. word goes back to PWC \I*Pǝƛ̣a-;\i Kab. sˊ̣, however, has many PWC  sources, and without other WC data the etymology is still questionable (we  must note that theoretically the Kab. form could be also compared with PEC  \I*bŭlƛ̣V̆\i 'house' q.v.).

The palatalisation in PWC *pˊ: can be explained by the influence of *-j. See Abdokov 1983, 86 (although the PAK form (in view of its AT correlates) should be kept apart from PEC \I*dādājV\i 'father' (q.v.).     In Lak. there occurred a reduction of the first vowel (cf. an analogous feature in Kryz.). Khin. has also a form \Ibɨj\i 'father', but this is most likely an old Shakh-Dagh loanword.

Much more widely spread are old derivates: \I*jiburV\i in Western EC languages ( > PN \I*jub,\i \I*ʔab-rV-;\i Av. \Iʕeˊbu,\i Chad. \Iʕiˊbur;\i Lak. \Ip:a,\i \Ip:ur-;\i Khin. \Ip:la\i), \I*HrVbV̄\i and \I*wVreba\i in Eastern EC languages (PL \I*rap:/*räp:,\i \I*wurep:a;\i PD \I*durup:,\i \I*birep:a\i).     Abdokov (1983, 129) compares the EC forms with a PAK root \I*bǝ-,\i  tentatively reconstructed by the author with the meaning 'to pierce, punch a  hole', on the basis of complex derivates like Kab. \Ipxǝʁa-mbǝ-n\i 'to punch a  hole (by a pointed obj.)' [in Карданов 1957 glossed: 'to crush, squeeze through'] and Shaps. \Ija-bǝ-xǝ-n\i 'to fall down (through)'. The morpheme is unclear etymologically (in fact, it may represent the same root as Ad. \Ibǝ\i 'hole, den'  - see Shagirov 1, 102), and the etymology seems dubious.

In PN and PWC there occurred an assimilations: *č < *č̣ (under the influence of the subsequent labial). Otherwise the correspondences are regular.     The root is also spread in some other Daghestan languages as a loan from Avar (Darg. \Ič̣aIbar\i 'floor') or Andian languages (Gunz. \Ič̣abar\i 'clay').

The root originally denoted a species of wild millet (used for making brooms), cf. the meanings in PTs and PD. Note that Darg.

Although within WC the root is attested only in Abaz., the probability of borrowing is rather small. Phonetic correspondences are quite regular (although there is some uncertainty about the first vowel; it is only clear that it was short and front); the uvular consonant had undergone a usual delabialisation before the following labial in PWC.
913|*qVmbVɫV|0|guest||0|*qVbVlV|421||0|qamal|227||0||0||0||0|    Borrowing is rather improbable, but the vocalism is hard to reconstruct. Despite Klimov (ESKY 150) the Avar word is not related to PN \I*ba-du\i 'orphan' etc. (see \I*ʔubV\i).

However, the correspondences (both phonetic and semantic) are in order, thus reconstructable for the PNC level. Its reflexes are almost in complementary distribution with those of *babV 'mother' q.v., thus the two roots may ultimately be the same (cf. also *ʔŏbV̄(jV) 'father').

First, we must for phonetic and semantic reasons dismiss the possibility of borrowing from Arab. \Iḳabāʔ\i 'langärmeliges Obergewand' (which, however, is also present in Tsezian languages: Bezht., Gunz. \Iḳaba,\i Gin. \Iḳoboj\i 'shirt'). Second, we must exclude interlingual borrowings: Arch. \Ipart:uq̇\i 'fur-coat' from Lak. (\Ibarq̇ut,\i dial. \Ibartuq̇\i with metathesis); Lak. \Iq:awaču\i ( < \I*q:abaču\i) from Avar or from Lezghian languages; some of the Andian forms also may be borrowed from Avar. Lezghian (Tab., Rut.) forms could be also considered as Avar loanwords. However, there are reasons to reconstruct the derivate \I*q̲ārṗV-čV\i (or *-cˊV) already for PEC, cf. Hurr. \Iqurbiži\i 'garment worn under mail-coat or helm' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 18), which was borrowed in Akk. \Ikurbisu,\i \Igurpisu.\i Thus the PL form \I*q̇ap:a(r)čaj\i may well be genuine (with a shift of laryngeal features usual for roots containing two or more stops).

Cf. also HU: Hurr. \Iawǝ,\i \Iajǝ\i 'face, front', Urart. \Iajǝ\i 'before' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 64; we must add that the HU root can actually reflect a merger of PEC \I*=ăɦwV\i 'face' and \I*ʔwɨ-\i 'before, in front' q.v.).

The initial lateral in the PA (Akhv.) form - if it belongs here - must be a remnant of the root for "eye" (PEC *ʡwilʡi q.v.) - cf. the same element in PA *ƛ̣-ins:Vr 'eyebrow' (see under *mĕrs̲A).      The medial resonant *-r- must be reconstructed because of preservation of *q̇ʷ in PA; unfortunately, in all of the three languages present (Akhv., Bezht. and Tsakh.) medial -r- disappears in such clusters.

The Darg. form is quite irregular (probably because of the expressive and reduplicated nature of the stem). PTs \I*c̣ɨc̣\i is probably an analogous simplification of \I*c̣ɨ(l)-c̣Vm\i - cf. the obl. base Tsez. \Ic̣ec̣mo-\i which better preserves the old structure.

However, since the probability of borrowing here is very small (all languages are not contacting geographically), it must be postulated for PEC.

PN \I*merc̣\i is obviously a transformation of \I*mec̣rV-\i (analogously from the oblique base to direct - a rather frequent process). Since there are no Av.-And.-Tsez. reflexes and the root is polysyllabic, the vocalic reconstruction is not very certain.

This etymology for PAK \I*ʡʷǝ\i 'mouth' is phonetically preferable to Trubetzkoy's comparison with Av. \Iabize\i 'say' (see Trubetzkoy 1930) or Balkarov's comparison with Av. \Iḳal\i 'mouth' (Balkarov  1964, 101). Abdokov (1983, 76) correctly compares the WC form with Gin. \Ihaqu\i  (misspelled as \Ihaq̇u\i), but adds also Av. \Iḳal\i and other unrelated EC forms.

950|*kērkV|0|gum (in mouth)||0|*kirki-l|449||0||0|*kek|241|*kerk (?)|19||0||0|    The Lezg. form may be joined with the rest if we assume the common meaning to be "covering" (of finger > 'finger-nail'; of tooth > 'gum'). Phonetically the correspondence is exact.

There are  some irregularities: a) PN has -q- instead of expected *-ħ- - maybe this can be explained by a contamination with the homonymous \I*nāqa\i 'breast' (q.v.) - 'palate' as 'breast of mouth' ? b) PD has *χ instead of expected *χ:. This may be explained by the influence of the phonetically similar PEC root \I*χɦwɨ̆mχV\i 'cheek' q.v. (note an analogous contamination in Avar; however, note also that this contamination in PD  must have taken place rather early, because the reflex of \I*χɦwɨ̆mχV\i - PD \I*χIʷaχI\i - has in PD already acquired the meaning 'buttock').
952|*simV (~ -ɨ̄-,-ä̆-)|0|lip; gum||0|*simV|451|*ZɨmV-|339|sina|252||0||0||0||0|    The comparison seems plausible in spite of some irregularities (mostly in PTs); -n- in Lak. may be due to the influence of the phonetically close \Isina\i 'gum, glue'.

However, it is not borrowed and must be reconstructed for PNC. Note that it has penetrated some geographically close languages: cf. Turk. \Ikanǯa,\i Osset. \Ixäʒ\i 'hook'. One could also compare Ing. \Iʁoz\i 'ring' - which should be kept apart from Chech. \Ihoz\i id. (phonetically absolutely incompatible).

959|*q̲̇arq̇aɫā|0|body||0|*q̇:arq̇:ala|460||0|q̇arq̇ala|261|*q̇arq̇ala|250||0||0||0|    It is most probable that the word was borrowed from some single source into many EC languages; but the source is not clear (it could be Avar or Dargwa; certainly borrowed are Arch. and Gunz. \Iq̇arq̇ala\i 'body'; a strange form is Gin. \Iq̇ʷarq̇ʷala\i 'carcass' with unclear labialisation). In any case, correspondences are regular, and some of the listed forms may be genuinely related, thus we deem it possible to reconstruct a PEC protoform.

Correspondences are regular. One phonetic problem, however, is that we should expect *ƛ: in PWC before an originally long vowel - this makes the comparison less reliable. The Khin. form can belong here if -id may be considered as a suffix, and \Inäḳ-\i < \I*läḳ-\i (although reasons for *l- > n- are not quite clear).         Abdokov (1983,73) also compares the PAK form with EC; the Bezht. form \Iƛ̣a\i  'behind' which he quotes, may in fact belong here too (although the source of it is unknown to us); however, other forms that are adduced, either do not  belong here (as Lezg. \Iḳul\i), or are misspelled (as Akhv. \Iraƛ̣:aƛi\i - instead of  \Iraq̇:ʷaƛ:i\i).

The original meaning was probably 'long (curved) bone', with later developments > 'long bone, spine'; 'curve, angle, corner' (cf. a combination of both trends in Lezghian languages). The Avar form is somewhat strange phonetically (*s:in would be regularly expected), so it may be a borrowing from some unknown early source.

In the East Dagestan area there occurred a double assimilation (\I*q̇ŏgV\i > \I*q̇ŏGV\i > \I*GŏGV\i); the Tsezian languages obviously preserve the more archaic structure.         It is possible that both Khin. \Iq̇aʁa\i and \Iq̇aq̇a-l\i are early loans from PL (before the assimilation *q̇- > *q:-); in Khin. there also exists a word \Iq̇äk\i 'burden, load' which could be the genuine reflex of \I*q̇ŏgV\i (however, the voiceless -k is not quite clear).

Some phonetic comments: both PN and PWC seem to point to a variant with an early loss of medial *-m- and transfer of the labialisation to the following vowel (otherwise the consonant in PWC would not be labialised, and in PN we would have a reflex *-mc̣- > *-ṭṭ-).

The most difficult problem is presented by the PA form (which should be regularly \I*qač̣u\i). We probably deal with a result of a complicated contamination here. Two different PEC roots, \I*gwǝcˊV\i 'arm' and \I*qarc̣ˊwV\i 'shoulder, arm' should have yielded at first PA \I*gʷVčV\i and \I*qač̣u\i respectively. The former must have acquired a uvular Anlaut( > \I*ʁʷVčV\i q.v.) under influence of the latter, and the latter must have developped into \I*ʁač̣u,\i with a subsequent assimilation to \I*ʁažu,\i under influence of the former (note that the two roots have stayed separate only in some Akhv. and Kar. dialects - everywhere else they have completely merged).

The comparison of PK \I*č̣iṗ-\i with PEC \I*ʒ̲ŏnʔŭ\i 'navel', proposed by Klimov (1965 255), is obviously untenable.

However, Inkh. \Ič̣iq̇i\i 'spleen' - which could be a remnant of the original non-dissimilated root - should better be considered a loan from Tind. \Ič̣iq̇:i.]\i The situation is further complicated by the fact that there exists another PNC root, \I*ḳ̲wĭc̣Ĕ\i / \I*c̣̲ĭḳwĔ\i (q.v.) with a similar meaning which certainly favours contaminations. Since within reflexes of both roots there is a variation of two basic meanings - "spleen" and "small intestine" - it is most probable that one of the roots meant originally "spleen", and the other - "small intestine", but now the meanings are hardly possible to attribute.

Several subgroups also reflect a specific variation of reflexes (*qw- or *χw-) which is a rather rare case.     Since the root is liable to metatheses (cf. the situation in Lezg.), one would be tempted also to compare PAK \I*tħa-\i in \I*tħa-(m)bǝLǝ\i 'lung' (Ad. \ItħābǝL,\i Kab. \ItħambǝL\i), Kab. \Itħa-m-sˊ̣ǝʁʷ\i 'liver'  with a possible reconstruction PWC \I*tǝχˊIʷa\i or \I*tǝqˊIʷa;\i however, it may be a pure coincidence, and Kuipers' analysis (\I*tħa\i as 'life, spirit') may be right (see Shagirov 2,83).

In this case it concerns the Lak. form (with progressive glottalisation) and the PL form: most probably the original \I*ḳHabV\i changed to \I*gHabV\i > PL \I*k:ap:\i through assimilation; later in a part of Lezghian dialects there occurred a new dissimilation (\I*k:ap:\i > \I*k:ap\i).

The root is well preserved in Lezg. languages and somewhat worse - elsewhere. In PA we would expect -č̣:-; this rare phoneme was probably weakened through dissimilation.     Cf. perhaps also WC data: PAT \I*q̇ʷač̣ˊa\i preserved in Abkh. \Ia-ʒ-q̇ʷaˊč̣ˊa\i "(water) pool".

The original stem was probably nominal ('a hollow, hole', cf. the situation in PL), but in most languages the stem became adjectival (more rarely, verbal) and obtained class prefixes. The class prefixes in this case replaced the initial laryngeal which is not reflected anywhere except PL.

Medial *-r- in PN is probably secondary (from a former obl. stem - \I*kars\i < \I*kas-rV-\i).

The original meaning must have been 'stick, wood' (preserved in most languages), with a development > 'leg' in PTs (cf., characteristically, both meanings at once in Bezht.), and, further, 'leg(s)' > 'groin' in Lak.

Note that this root was specifically used to denote a small bone for throwing (Russ. 'альчик') - hence also the meaning 'lot' in Lak.     See Abdokov 1983, 74 (Tsakh.-WC).

Except for the metathesis (a frequent phenomenon in roots of this structure), correspondences are regular.     It is very tempting to compare also Av. \Iṭiq̇:ʷaˊ\i 'horseshoe; sole of foot', Chad. \Iṭuq̇:eˊ-n\i 'horseshoe'. However, dialectal forms (Andal. \Iuq̇:a\i) show that here ṭ- goes back to Proto-Avar *ƛ̣- (\I*ƛ̣iq̇:ʷa\i). The comparison is thus possible only if we assume a non-trivial assimilation in Proto-Avar: \I*ƛ̣iq̇:ʷa\i < \I*ṭilq̇:ʷa.\i The inclusion of the Av. form (paradigm B: \Iṭiq̇:ʷaˊ-dul,\i \Iṭuq̇:-biˊ,\i Chad. \Iṭuq̇eˊni-l,\i \Iṭuq̇-biˊ/ṭuq̇naˊ-l\i) would allow to make the PEC reconstruction more precise: \I*ṭɦä̆lq̲̇wā\i ( ~ -ǝ̄).

The comparison seems, nevertheless, quite probable; initial *mo- in PL is secondary - probably under analogy with body part names like \I*morkol\i 'finger/toe'.

Lak. \Ičannu\i < \I*kannu.\i Except for a metathesis (a rather usual phenomenon), correspondences are regular (although we would rather expect -u-, not -a- in Lak.; the wrong vowel is probably due to Ablaut).

Phonetically the forms correspond well to each other, but the semantic variation ("vertebra"/"back of head", on one side, and "part of shin; thigh, hip", on the other side) give reason for some doubts in the validity of reconstruction.

Correspondences between PA, PTs and PL are regular (the semantic shift 'bush' > 'woman's hair' is observed in other cases, too). The Darg. form, however, is not quite regular (-t:- may be a result of dissimilation, but the loss of labialisation is not clear).
1036|*gwɨm(V)gV|982|tube, chute||0|*gVmVgV|529||0||0||0|*k:ʷɨmk:|624||0||0|    An Av.-Lezg. isogloss, but both semantically and phonetically quite plausible.

A very similar stem is present in Georgian - \Ikočori\i 'forelock' - whence it penetrated Tsez languages (Tsez., Gin. \Ikočori,\i Gunz. \Ikočori\i / \Igočori,\i Bezht. Tlad., Khosh. \Iköčöri\i), Av. dialects (cf. Chad. \Igočor\i) and Ossetian (Osset. \Igocora\i, see Abayev 1958, 521-522). The Georgian form itself probably has an EC source.

In PTs the medial -w- probably was lost rather early (otherwise we should expect *-χ- in cluster with a previous resonant); otherwise correspondences are quite regular (Lak. \Ihuru\i regularly < \I*muhuru\i with loss of the initial *mV-). The root is often accompanied by *-rV (in PN, Lak., PL) which must be here a former plural suffix.
1041|*GĕrVnV / *rĕGVnV (~ ʁ)|0|spring wool||0|*ʁorVn (~ -a-)|534|*ʁ:ɔrVnV / *rɔʁ:VnV|412||0||0||0||0||0|    An Av.-And-Tsez. isogloss.

Seems quite plausible phonetically and semantically (the correlation "sinew" : "thread, wire" is usual). EC > Osset. \Ixal\i / \Ixalä\i 'thread', Balk. \Ixalǝ\i id. (see Abayev 1989, 135).

The original meaning must have been 'pipe, kennel ~ blood pipe, vein'. The PC form suggests rather short *-ă- against the WC evidence implying long *-ā-; however, since the form is attested only in Gunz. and the vowel is nasalized (nasalisation often shifts vowel reflexes), we prefer to reconstruct a long vowel in PNC.

Cf. also Hurr. \Išāri(y)-annǝ\i 'coat of mail' ( > Akkad. \Iš/sirijām,\i Hebr. \Isirjōn\i), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 42.     It is tempting to compare the reconstructed form \I*č̲ɦǝ̄rV\i with East Iranian forms meaning 'coat of mail', 'armour': Osset. \Izɣär\i / \Iäsqär,\i Afg. \Izɣara\i etc. (see Abayev 1989, 309), which are etymologically rather obscure. A more recent loan from Nakh is Osset. \Ic̣ar\i / \Ic̣arä\i 'skin, bark' (see Abayev 1958, 330).     Shagirov  (1983, 134) compares the Lezg. forms with some WC forms meaning 'milk'; this  is obviously wrong, both for semantic reasons (the meaning 'cream' in some  Lezg. languages is secondary) and for phonetic reasons (see the discussion  under PNC \I*rħăƛwV\i).

The Lak. form is reduplicated (\Ič̣anaḳ\i < \I*ḳanaḳ\i); the PWC form has a frequent prefixed *p- - possibly, a remnant of a class prefix.     See Abdokov 1983, 74.

Reconstruction of the medial resonant is not quite certain (based only on PTs nasalisation).

Otherwise more or less regular.

In Lak. there occurred an assimilation (\Ilal\i < \I*ral\i), and in Rut. - a metathesis (\Ilar\i < \I*ral\i), quite natural for a root with two different liquids. The original structure is very well preserved in PD (where *d- < *r-) and PN. In general the comparison seems quite plausible both phonetically and semantically. Perhaps we should also add (with metathesis): Akhv. \Iħara\i 'faeces'.

Several forms reflect the old Ablaut stem \I*-irqV.\i     As with other verbs of "beating", there exist some derivates meaning "wound" ( > "festering wound", "pus"), notably PC \I*ʔǝ˜χ:V\i ( < \I*ʔorqV-n\i) et al.     See Абдоков 1983, 167.

The reflex *-š in PN (Chech. \Imarš\i) is explained either by a special position of *čw after -r-, or (which may be more probable) by contamination with PN \I*marš\i 'muzzle, snout' in Chech.

The verb is well preserved in Nakh, Av., Tsezian and Darg; however, the vocalism is impossible to reconstruct (probably due to distorted Ablaut).     The Lezgian languages have preserved only the old derivate \I*ruʁV-nV\i (with metathesis \I*nuʁVrV\i) "wound" ( > PL "pus"), reflected also in Av. \Iruʁun\i "wound" (Chad. \Iroʁoˊn;\i Av. > And. \Iruʁun,\i Akhv. \Iruʁu\i) and PTs \I*muχru\i "birth-mark" (PGB \I*muʁru\i > Gunz. \Imuʁru,\i Bezht. Tlad. \Imuhro\i). Another old derivate from the same root is \I*rVrʁV\i "fight, war" reflected in Av. \Iraʁ\i (gen. \Iraʁuˊ-l\i) and PD \I*derʁ\i (Ak. \Iderʁ,\i Chir. \Iderʁ,\i Ur. \Idirʁ,\i Kub. \Idīʁ\i etc.). A variant \I*d-VrʁVn\i is probably reflected in Akhv. \Idi˜ʁi\i 'wound'.     Abdokov (1983, 188) compares WC forms: Abkh. \Ia-ʁaˊ,\i Abaz. \Iaʁa\i 'enemy' (PAT \I*aɣa\i), as well as Kab. (archaic) \Iāʁ\i 'angry' which we were unable to locate in existing sources. The comparison is tempting, but for WC one must reconstruct \I*aGV,\i with *G not corresponding normally to EC *ʁ - unless the AT forms are actually borrowed from Adygh (in which case a reconstruction \I*aʁV\i is also possible). Additional information is required to clear up this situation.

In PN a semantic shift  "secretion (from the body)"> "herpes, eczema" had taken place.     The EC-WC comparison was suggested by Abdokov (Abdokov 1983, 84); despite  numerous expressive changes in WC languages, the ultimate correspondence  between EC \I*ɦ[a]mʒ̲ū\i and WC \I*c:ʷa\i is quite regular.

In PWC nasalisation is a remnant of the original Inlaut resonant; labialisation of the second consonant is lost, as very often, in dissimilation to the preceding labial consonant. It is interesting to note the exceptional preservation of the laryngeal in some Av.-And. languages, perhaps pointing to a PEC variant with a rare structure \I*ɦṗĭlc̣̲wǝ̆.\i     A loan from Lak. or Darg. (with expressive irregularities) is Tsakh. Gelm. \IṗaIlč̣\i 'eye secretion'.

Since normally clusters of two Inlaut stops are prohibited, this word is most probably a compound with an expressive first component (\I*Hăχ-\i); the second component must be = PEC \I*tujV\i 'spittle' q.v.

This is because there is a number of similar (phonetically and semantically) forms in several EC languages, which may have been confused and contaminated (due to expressive meaning). Perhaps we should also note Rut. \Imiq̇I\i 'cow dung', Tsakh. \Imɨq̇I\i (Gelm. \Imiq̇I\i), Bud. \Ineq̇\i 'dirt' which could alternatively be compared with Chech. \Imēq̇alg.\i

In most languages the root combines the meanings "gall" and "anger", so they must have existed simultaneously already in PNC.     Abdokov (1983, 84) compares the EC forms with PWC \I*ca\i 'to burn', which is  not plausible for both phonetic and semantic reasons (see PNC \I*=ĕrc̲Ă\i).
1066|*ḳwŏrf̲V|0|urine||0|*ḳʷVrš:V|554||0|ḳu-š:i-|334||0||0||0||0|    An Av.-Lak. isogloss; since, however, Lak. has -x:- (not -š:-) as a root consonant, it does not resemble a loanword.

The root is best preserved in the Western area; however, its remnant in PL (\I*nVḳʷV-\i) makes the common EC reconstruction very probable. The Khin. form \Iḳä\i is possibly a reduction of original \I*HVnḳä;\i a trace of nasalisation may be possibly observed in the obl. base \Iḳi-mi-.\i     Some problems are raised by the cluster *-ṭq̇- in PN; perhaps \I*ħāṭq̇a\i is an originally suffixed form ( < \I*ħāḲ-dV\i with a former plural suffix).

1069|*=olχwV̆r|0|to defecate||0|*=iχ:-|557||0||0||0|*ʔalχʷVr- / *-χIʷ-|648||0||0|    An Av.-And.-Lezg. isogloss. The comparison is rather probable, but needs several phonetic comments. *-l- in PL (unambiguously established on basis of Ag., Tsakh. -r-) corresponds directly to -n- in the PA derivate \I*ʔinχ:u,\i thus it must be reconstructed for PEC. However, in PA we should expect a weakened reflex *-χ-, not *-χ:- after a medial liquid. The reason of the irregularity is probably an early loss of *-l- in the verbal stem (where all Andian languages and Av. reflect a pure stem \I*=iχ:-\i) and the consequent strengthening -χ- > -χ:- in the intervocalic position. Strong *-χ:- in \I*ʔinχ:u\i is obviously a result of later analogy with \I*=iχ:-.\i
1070|*ɦujV (~ -ō-)|0|faeces||0||0||0|uI-t|335||0|*ʡoj (~ -u-)|649||0||0|    An expressive Lak.-Ag. isogloss; the comparison is possible if we assume that Lak. -t ( = -t:) is a former plural suffix.

Vocalic correspondences are not quite clear (because of the root's expressive nature). In Khin. there occurred a dissimilative deglottalisation -č̣ > -č (usual in roots of this type).     The root probably denoted excrements of small animals or birds (cf. the semantic reflexes in most languages).

The common EC derivate \I*wiḳ̲wVnV\i (which should have given \I*wiḳʷVn(a)\i in PL) merged with PL \I*wilq̇ʷina\i (a derivate from the root \I*=ilq̲̇wVn\i). The EC-WC comparison see in Абдоков 1983, 162.

We have reconstructed the structure \I*Hrĕmk̲wɨ̆,\i taking into account the relic nasalisation in Gunz.; if it is secondary, a reconstruction \I*rHĕk̲wɨ̆\i is also possible.     An obvious EC loan is Osset. \Iryg\i 'dust' (see Abayev 1973, 444; the suggested Indo-Iranian etymology of the Osset. word is absolutely unsecure).

An expressive root with several irregularities: the most severe one is PA *χ:- instead of expected *q:-. Other irregularities are mostly assimilations (in PN: *q̇- < *q- before *ṭ; in PD: *-t < *ṭ after *q-) or dissimilations (in PTs, where -ṭ- would be expected). All this is rather usual in a root with two stops (especially in an expressive one).

The PN form \I*naṭq̇u\i probably reflects an original plural form (\I*naṭq̇u\i < \I*na(w)q̇-ṭu\i < \I*nĕwq̇-dV\i). In PL and Darg. there occurred (for expressive reasons or due to a rare cluster *wq̇ ? ) a strengthening of the word: they reflect a variant \I*nĕwq̲̇ŭ.\i The medial -r- in PD is obviously secondary, probably having penetrated there from an original plural form in *-r, being later substituted in PD by the *-bi-plural.     The old Ablaut \I*nĕwq̇ŭ\i / \I*nĭwq̇V̆-\i in this root has remained only in PGB (where the obl. base \I*mɨq̇a-\i < \I*nĭwq̇V̆-\i). Obl. bases like Arch. \Inibqi-\i or Tab. \Iniwq:u-\i in this case are ambiguous (in Arch. - because of the neutralisation of vowels in the first accentless syllable, in Tab. - because of the merger of *ä and *i).

However, in Av. and PL the forms are probably genuine (because of phonetic and semantic differences). It is possible that *-ṭV is originally a suffix here (see notes on the Av. form); in that case we can compare Hurr. \Išūnǝ\i 'breath, soul, self' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 32). [Cf. also Georg. \Ic̣winṭli\i 'snot' > Bacb. \Isinṭr\i id.?].

The PTs form contains a rare phoneme *ʁ- which in this case must be just a variant of PTs *χ (*ʁ- is reconstructed on basis of PTsKh \I*-ʁu\i present only in the compound \I*biƛ̣-ʁu;\i we may think of a secondary voicing in this position). There exists a chance of finding a Lezghian cognate: PL \I*χIap:,\i obl. \I*χIop:ɨ-,\i pl. \I*χIop:-Vr\i 'sheep, sheep-flock' (collect.). This would be possible if we suppose a metathesis \I*χIop:Vr\i < \I*χIor-p:V\i in early PL, with a reanalysis of the original plural suffix *-p:(V) as a part of the root.

The comparison is quite satisfactory both phonetically and semantically.

Correspondences are regular - except that we would rather expect *ǝ˜ or *i˜, not *a˜ in PTs (since PN has a long vowel here). Thus it is not excluded that the PTs form was borrowed from early PA.

See Trombetti 1923, Trubetzkoy 1930, 276, Яковлев 1941, Балкаров 1969, Шагиров 1977, Abdokov 1983.  Correspondences  are  fully regular (except only the initial l- in Khin., which has  probably appeared under the influence of \Ilix\i 'ox' and \Iläq\i 'calf'). We must note,  however,  that the usual Nakh material compared with this root is not PN \I*jētt\i 'cow', but PN \I*psṭu\i 'ox, bull' which can not be related to this root  phonetically (the reduction of the syllable *jǝ̄- can not be explained in any way) and goes back to another PNC root (\I*cˊwijo\i 'man, male' q.v.). On the other hand, PN  \I*jētt\i  is  a perfect phonetic match for \I*jǝ̄mcō\i (if we take into account the absolute regularity of the phonetic process *-mC- > *-tt- in PN).     The comparison of this root with PK \I*wacˊ-\i 'ram' (Климов 1965) is not very persuasive for semantic reasons. Perhaps, some traces of this root in Kartvelian (as a loanword, possibly from Tsez. languages) may be seen in Georg. dial. \Iaš,\i \Iiš,\i \Iišo\i 'addressing an ox, bull', \Iišia\i 'bull-calf'(a term of endearment) (see Kavtaradze 1972).

Correspondences are normal (although the vowel *-ü-, as usual, raises some doubts), although PA has a quite unexpected *ƛ- (regularly *l- would be expected). This may be a dissimilation in voice; or, perhaps, other languages have undergone a secondary voicing *ƛ- > *Ł- before the next voiced *-d- - in this case we should reconstruct PEC *ƛürdV. [The Darg. and Lak. words for 'kid' should not be confused with a widely spread word for 'boy' in Lezghian languages - Lezg. \Igada,\i Tsakh. \Igade\i etc. - which is a loan from Azer. \Igädä\i 'boy; beggar' < Pers.].

The root contains a rare cluster of two resonants (it is not excluded that *-nV here is an old suffix). The uvular reflex in PTs (*q̇ʷ-) must be explained by PTs pharyngealization (although its source is not quite clear). All other correspondences are regular, and the root seems quite reliable.     If we assume that *-nV is a suffix here, the root \I*ḳwărV\i could be linked with another Av.-And. derivate, \I*ḳʷVr-tV\i 'young donkey' (Av. \Iḳert,\i Chad. \Iḳert,\i Cham. Gig. \Iḳorti,\i Bagv. Tlo. \Iḳortu;\i Av. > Arch. \IḳeIrt,\i Bezht. \Iḳerṭ,\i Gunz. \Iḳert\i).

The only problem is the vowel -o- in PTsKh ( < PTs *-ɔ-); however, the word is attested only in Khvarsh. and Inkh., and thus a reconstruction of PTs *ɨ or *ǝ is also not absolutely excluded (a regular reflex would be PTs \I*χ:ɨr\i).     See Abdokov 1983, 123.

The root should be distinguished from a similar \I*GačV\i q.v. (because in Lak. there exists an opposition \Iq:aIča\i - \IquIrč̣u\i).     The EC-WC comparison is acceptable if we assume a metathesis in one of the subgroups - which is a rather usual phenomenon in NC roots (especially those containing two stops).     Other etymologies of the WC form (comparison with Georg. \Ideḳeuli\i 'heifer' in Rogava 1958 or with Tat. \Iičke\i 'goat' in Shagirov 2) seem to us less acceptable, both for phonetic and semantic reasons.

Phonetic correspondences are regular.     This root is not preserved in Lak, being superseded by \Ic̣uku\i < PEC \I*ʒĭkV̆\i 'kid'. It is interesting to note, however, that in the Khosr. dialect the plural form from \Ic̣uku\i is \Ic̣u-rt:u,\i where the root \I*c̣̲ü̆hnV̄\i may be preserved (as \Ic̣u-\i); the lit. Lak has already a new form \Ic̣uk-ri.\i         There is some evidence pointing to a PEC oblique stem \I*c̣̲ü̆hnV̄-rV-\i (cf. Akhv. \Ic̣:ir(i\i), PL \I*c̣eh-rV-,\i perhaps also Lak. \Ic̣u-r-\i in the plur. Khosr. \Ic̣u-r-t:u\i).     Abdokov (1983, 118) compares the WC root with PEC \I*ƛ̣̲äɦɫǝ̄\i 'lamb', which is  impossible for phonetic reasons. The same author (1983, 124) compares the EC  forms with Kab. \Ic̣āqʷa\i 'antelope' (which he explains as a compound: \Ic̣a\i + \Iqʷa\i  'goat' + 'pig'). We were unable to find this exact form in dictionaries; only  in Nogma 217 there is a word ц̂ак"h [ = /c̣āq:a/] 'a k. of antelope, джейран',  which is interesting (see Turchaninov's notes ibid., as well as Abayev 1979,  58-59 on Osset. \Isäʁ\i 'goat' = Old Ind. \Ichāga-,\i IE \I*sk'ago-\i), but isolated and  has obviously nothing to do with EC \I*c̣ü̆hnV̄.\i

The second consonant, which should have been reflected as *-k- in Av.-And.-Tsez. languages, became early assimilated to the reflex of initial *ʒ (*c̣: in Proto-Av.-And.-Tsez, > *c in PTs). Assimilations and metatheses are quite usual in roots of this type (containing two or more stops), thus the unity of all listed forms does not raise any doubts.

Medial *-j- is postulated to account for the development *-ʒˊ- > *-st- in PN, while *-w- is reflected as *-b- in PN and as labialisation in PWC.
1117|*cˊ̲īmV|0|young goat, goat||0|*č:imV|596||0||0||0||0||0|*pčˊ:VmV / *pčˊ:VnV|309|    The EC-WC comparison is quite plausible phonetically and semantically; its only drawback is the root's very sparse representation in the EC area. See Abdokov 1983, 116 (Av. : WC, with admixture of many unrelated forms). However, all  other etymologies of the WC material (comparison with Cham. \Ičala\i 'goat' [Rogava 1956, 75], with PEC \I*c̣̲ü̆hnV̄\i 'goat' [Balkarov 1964, 97-98],  with Iranian  (Avest.  \Ibūza-,\i Pers. \Ibuz\i 'he-goat') [Shagirov 1, 85]) are  improbable for phonetic reasons.

1119|*dVrq̇wV|772|he-goat||0|*dVq̇(ʷ)V-n|597|*ṭɨq̇ʷV A|456||0||0||0||0||0|    This root is probably reflected also in HU: Hurr. \Itaɣǝ\i 'man, male' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 26). There is not enough information to reconstruct the vocalism. *-r- is obligatory in the reconstruction to account for the preservation of uvular *-q̇ʷ- ( > Av. -ʕ-) in Inlaut; without a previous liquid *-q̇ʷ- regularly yields -ḳ-.

One feels tempted to compare this root with PEC \I*dHogwV\i 'donkey, ass'  (q.v.), spread in the Lak-Darg-Lezg. area (all the forms could be united  under a single protoform \I*ṭHōgwV,\i assuming some metatheses and possibly interdialectal loans); however, there still remain semantic and phonetic difficulties, and the question is still open.

Correspondences are regular, but there is not enough data to reconstruct vowels (the PN and Tsez vowels can go back to a variety of protoforms, and the Lezg. data in this case are not reliable, because in a long word like this vocalic assimilations were possible in the first syllable).     The word is probably an old (common EC) Indo-Iranian loan (IE \I*u̲etero-\i 'a one-year old animal', see Starostin 1988, 113).

All other languages reflect either a derivate (with a productive suffix *-lV), or some old compounds with unclear second components (PC *-q̇V, PA *-(ro)χi, PD *-χa). Correspondences of the first part are quite regular (note the specific development *ha- in PA and *ʕɔ- in PC - reflecting a secondary labialisation \I*ɦʷimV-\i < \I*ɦimV-\i), and it seems worth reconstructing for PEC.         We must note the resemblance of PEC \I*ɦimV\i with Semitic (cf., e.g., Arab. \Iħimār\i 'ass, donkey'). The Arabic form was probably directly borrowed only in one language (cf. Kar. Tok. \Iħamar\i which stands apart from all other Andian forms), but it may be an old Wanderwort common to both East Caucasian and Semitic languages.

Although very distorted, the root may belong to the set of early Indo-Iranian loanwords in EC: cf. Osset. \Isänɨkk\i 'kid' < Indo-Iran. *sčanika-, cf. Bel. \Išanikh,\i \Išinik\i 'kid', Yagn. \Isanča\i etc.  (see Abayev 1979, 71-72).

In spite of various irregular changes (typical for an expressive root with two stops), the initial phonetic shape can be more or less securely rebuilt (semantically there are no problems). Initial velar in PTs may be explained by the influence of another root (reflected in Inkh. as \Iḳuč̣e\i 'puppy'); a possible explanation of the velar in some Andian languages see above.

It is not excluded, that the Av. dialectal forms are borrowed from Lak., and that the Khin. form is borrowed from the Shakhdagh languages. However, the Tsezian and Lezghian forms can not be borrowed from any external source.     The root is close phonetically and semantically (and thus reveals a tendency to contaminate) with PEC \I*gwăǯē\i 'dog, bitch'. However, they are opposed in several languages and must be kept apart.

However, the Tab. form is isolated within Lezghian and quoted from Khaidakov 1973, which makes the comparison with PA much less reliable.

In Inkh. the initial ḳ- is a result of assimilation ( < *k-), as is clearly seen from other evidence (the same process happened in Ud. and Abkh.).

All other correspondences are surprisingly regular (if we separate all the secondary interlingual borrowings).     The etymon is, of course a Wanderwort (cf. Kartv. \I*ḳaṭu,\i late Latin \Icattus,\i Slav. \I*kotъ\i, Osset. \Igädɨ\i, see Abayev 1958, 510, etc.). Klimov (1967, 380-381) tried to explain its presence in the Caucasian languages as a loan from Armenian; but the word no doubt existed already at least in PWC and in sub-protolanguages like PL and PA which makes this theory impossible.     Even if the word is borrowed from some external source, the borrowing occurred so early that we think it justified to include the word into the common NC wordstock.

Otherwise the correspondences are regular. A semantic shift "quail" > "hen" seems plausible (if we deal with a genuine root).
1141|*gwāṭa (~-ǝ̄-,-e)|0|hen|*kōta-m|395||0|*gudV|472||0||0|*ḳaṭa|702||0|*k:(ʷ)Vṭǝ|320|    A difficult case. See Dzhavakhishvili 1937,613-617, Klimov 1963,195-196, Shagirov 1977,159 (comparing the above forms and Kartvelian \I*katam-\i 'hen'),  Abdokov 1983, 116.     The listed forms are related with a great degree of probability, but several assimilative processes must have happened in different languages (which is usual for root structures of this type, containing two stops. In PN (where *gw- regularly > *k-) \I*gwāṭa\i > \I*kōṭa-\i > \I*kōta-\i (progressive assimilation); in PTs \I*gwāṭa\i > \I*gʷɨṭV\i > \I*gʷɨdV\i (also progressive assimilation). In PL \I*gwāṭa\i > \I*ḳ(ʷ)aṭa\i (regressive assimilation); on PWC see above.     A suspicious feature is loss of labialisation in PL and PAK; it may suggest that the protoform should be rather reconstructed as \I*gāṭwa\i (with shift of labialisation in PN and PAT), because labialisation of dentals is in general easier lost than the labialisation of velars.     In view of everything said it seems probable that the Kartvelian name for "hen" (\I*katam-\i) is an old Nakh loanword - since the Nakh form can not be separated from other EC data.

Phonetically and semantically quite plausible, thus the PNC antiquity is possible. But a similar root exists in Altaic (Turkic \I*takɨku\i / \I*tagɨku\i 'hen,  cock', Mong. \Itakija\i etc.), and an early loan is not excluded (note an obvious  late loan: Darg. Tsud. \It:awqa\i which stands quite apart from all other Darg. forms < Turkish \Itavuq\i).

The PWC form is metathesized (\I*mǝšˊʷV\i < \I*šˊʷVmV\i), otherwise corresponding quite well to EC reflexes. The Lak. and Darg. forms reflect a rather unique suffixed variant \I*cwä̆m-ƛV\i (such a lateral suffix is unknown elsewhere), and thus raise some doubts; but it is hard to separate these forms from all the rest.         See Bork 1907, 26-27, 30, Trombetti 1923, 364, Рогава 1956, 28, Шагиров 1977, 273, Abdokov 1983, 119-120. All the authors link the EC and NC forms  also with PK \I*da(sˊ)tw-\i 'bear' which is hard to justify phonetically, as well as  the attempts to make an inner morphological analysis of the PWC form (made in  Рогава 1956, 28, 36, Ломтатидзе 1961, 118).

This is an interesting word, signifying both a beast (hyena, fox, wolf) and a bird (hawk, falcon) of prey.         It is interesting to note that the word for "hawk" in Gunz. is \Igudba-q\i (derived from \Igud-ba\i "fowl"), and in Abkhaz we have \Ia-ḳʷǝṭ-rǝˊ-χˊšˊ\i 'a hawk hunting for fowl' (\Iaˊ-χˊšˊ\i 'hawk') and \Ia-ḳʷǝṭ-rǝˊ-bga\i / \Ia-ḳʷṭǝˊ-r-bga\i 'fox' (\Iaˊ-bga\i 'fox'). In both cases we have forms containing PNC \I*gwāṭV\i 'hen' (q.v.), and phonetically close to the root \I*gwērdV\i that we are dealing with. This may have several explanations:         a) a pure coincidence (which is rather unlikely);         b) the root \I*gwērdV\i meaning 'beast or bird of prey' merged in Gunz. and Abkh. with \I*gwāṭV\i (Gunz. \Igudo,\i Abkh. \Ia-ḳʷṭǝˊ\i) and came to mean 'bird of prey hunting for fowl';         c) the PEC root \I*gwērdV\i could be assimilated from \I*gwērṭV\i < \I*gwēṭV-rV-,\i representing the oblique base of \I*gwāṭV\i 'hen', and was itself actually meaning '(one hunting) for fowl' in PNC.     [One may note also an aberrant form: Bezht. Tlad. \Ikordaḳo\i 'kite' which may represent a contamination of this root with another one, reflected in Bezht. Khosh. \Ikorzaḳo\i id.].         We are inclined to accept the third hypothesis (because it explains well all the semantic diversity in modern EC reflexes).

This may be explained either by vocalic metathesis (\I*chwōlĕ\i / \I*chwēlŏ\i) or, perhaps, by the original trisyllabic root structure (\I*chwōlĕ\i < earlier \I*cEhwōlĕ,\i cf. the probably connected - as a loan or as a common heritage from an earlier source - Semitic form \I*čuʕāl\i 'fox').

Palatalisation of *Lˊ in PWC is, as in several other cases, caused by the early merger of *L and *Lˊ in PWC.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 277, Abdokov 1983, 118.

Note the same notation λ- (as in \Iλama\i) in Cham. (only MSU recordings of the word are known to us; the strong λ:- in Av. presupposes the same consonant in Andian languages). A recent loan from Andian (Cham. or Tindi, where the root is not attested) is Inkh. \Iλunka\i 'roe'. Less clear is the origin of PGB \I*λiga\i 'roe' (Bezht., Gunz. \Iλiga\i) - is it an irregular development (with voicing -k- > -g-) from \I*λ̲im-kV;\i or is it a Nakh loan (cf. Ing. \Ilijg\i 'roe' with a diminutive suffix -g)?     b) \I*λ̲im-tV\i ( > \I*λ̲wintV\i) reflected in PD *xʷinta (Ak. \Ihinta\i 'doe', Ur. \Ihinta,\i Kub. \Ixʷinta,\i Kait. \Išʷenta\i 'roe'). Borrowed from Darg. are Lak. \Ihinta\i 'chamois, gazelle' and (from an Old Darg. form \I*finta\i) Av. \Ipintaˊ\i 'gazelle, antelope' (Chad. \Ibutaˊ\i id.).     The proposed derivation of \I*λ̲imkV\i and \I*λ̲imtV\i seems probable to us; however, we must note that suffixes *-kV and *-tV are very rare, and more checking is needed to make a final decision on this etymology.
1157|*bü̆ɫV|1275|horned animal|*bula|406|*bVlV|627|*bala (~ -L:-)|479||0||0|*p:el-|716||0|*bǝlǝ|329|    The EC-WC comparison seems quite satisfactory both phonetically and semantically.
1158|*winλVɫV (~ -lV)|0|rodent; boar||0|*bVλVn|628||0||0||0|*wirλ:al (~ -l:)|717||0||0|    An Av.-Lezg. isogloss. The meaning 'boar, pig' of Av. \Iboλoˊn\i is clearly secondary (the word has superseded the original name for 'boar' which was \I*wHarƛ̣̲wǝ\i q.v.), thus the comparison with the PL name for 'rodent' seems justified ('rodent' > 'animal digging earth' > 'boar'). Phonetically the correspondence is exact.
1159|*wHārƛ̣̲wǝ|626|boar, pig|*bur(u)ḳˊ (~ -ū-,-ḳ)|407||0|*buƛʷV B|480|burḳ|377||0|*waIƛ̣:ʷ|718||0|*Lˊawǝ|330|    Loss of *-r- in PL is secondary (probably because of pharyngealisation and the position before a lateral). Except this, and the rather usual metathesis in PWC (\I*Lˊawǝ\i < \I*waLǝ\i), correspondences are quite regular and the root seems securely reconstructable for PNC.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241. Klimov (1971, 224-225) proposes to consider  Georg. \Ibur(w)aḳ-\i 'pig, piglet' as a Nakh loan which seems rather probable. Abdokov (1983, 114) compares EC forms with PAK \I*bLanaˊ\i 'doe' which raises  serious semantic objection (Ad. \ILawǝ\i is also cited, but only in a foot-note).

Except for a somewhat irregular behaviour of the medial resonant (we should expect its preservation in Lezg.), correspondences are normal. At least the PN-PD comparison is quite valid; the Lezg. form, since it is quite isolatedin Lezgian, may be an old loan from Darg.

We should also mention Cham. (U.-Gakv.) \Iaχaša\i 'kite', Abkh. \Iaˊ-χˊšˊ\i 'hawk' and Kab. \Iwāšxa\i 'badger' (see Abdokov 1983, 119). They reveal some  similarity with the forms listed, but are absolutely irregular phonetically. They may be borrowed from some of the neighbouring Caucasian languages (?), or, perhaps, from an Iranian source (cf. Avest. \Ikahrkāsa-,\i M.-Pers. \Ikarkās\i 'kite'?).

Forms of other languages correlate with each other very well, and the root is well reconstructable for PNC.     The Av.-And. and WC forms were compared by Klimov (1968, 229), who also adduced the Kartvelian material: Georg. \Iciq̇wi\i 'squirrel' (which must be a loan from some EC source). The Georgian word was, in its turn, borrowed in Bezht. (Khosh.) \Iciq̇i,\i (Tlad.) \Ič̣eq̇i\i 'squirrel'.
1163|*darq̇ʷV|380|weasel, ermine||0|*darq̇ʷa|631||0|t:arq̇a|380||0||0||0||0|    An And.-Lak. isogloss; both phonetically and semantically perfect, thus probably going back to PEC.

The Ub. form may be theoretically compared also with PEC \I*darq̇wV\i q.v.; we prefer, however, to compare it with PEC \I*rĭŁ̲wV\i (thus arriving at the PNC reconstruction \I*rĭg̲wĂ\i), because it matches exactly (both semantically and phonetically) PN \I*daχḳa\i 'mouse'.      The comparison of PN and Ub. forms was first proposed by Trubetzkoy (1930, 277). See also Abdokov 1983, 120-121 (although with a great deal of confusion between several NC roots). The Kartvelian material (PK \I*(sˊ)tagw-\i 'mouse'),  linked with this root by Bork (1907, 27) and Klimov (1963, 175) may belong here as a  loan from some EC source (or else it may be compared with PEC \I*darq̇wV\i q.v.).

The vocalism is hard to reconstruct in a trisyllabic root with some irregular phonetic changes (due to the root's expressive nature).     It is interesting to note Azer. \Idälä\i 'squirrel' (possibly < *däläg), which has no Turk. etymology and thus may be borrowed from an EC source (the Azer. word, in its turn, is borrowed in Kryz. \Idälä,\i Khin. \Idelä\i 'squirrel').
1167|*tenƛ̣̲wV|0|weasel||0||0||0||0|*terɣʷa|362|*tenƛ̣:ʷ|723||0||0|    A Darg.-Lezg. isogloss (for phonetic reasons this root can not be compared with PEC \I*darq̇wV\i and other similar names for weasels).

The specific cluster *št (*šṭ) in PN is probably a result of suffixation (\I*χHVrc̣ˊ-ṭV;\i cf. an analogous dental suffix in other 'weasel' names: PN \I*dingV-ṭ,\i \I*šVrṭq̇V\i < \I*šVrq̇-ṭV\i).

1171|*q̇welʕǝ (~ -ʡ-, -ō)|237|mouse||0||0||0|ḳulu|383||0|*q̇Iʷel|727||0||0|    A Lak.-Lezg. isogloss; for phonetic reasons this root must be kept separate from PNC \I*ɦnǝ̄q̲̇wǝ̄\i 'mouse' q.v. If we assume a suffix in PD \I*q̇ur-k:V\i 'rat' (Ak. \Iq̇urga,\i Ur. \Iq̇urgu\i etc.), this form could also belong here (\I*q̇ur-k:V\i < \I*q̇ul-k:V\i).
1172|*jVcwĔ|209|mouse||0||0||0||0|*waca|365||0||0|*jašˊ(ʷ)V|335|    A Darg.-WC isogloss, but probably very archaic (see Starostin 1982, 218). PD \I*waca\i can only go back to a PEC form like \I*jVcwV\i with metathesis of labialisation (original *w- would have yielded PD *b-).     From other EC languages one could possibly list also PGB \I*ʔɨ˜z-baṭu\i (Bezht. \Iizmaṭo,\i Gunz. \Iǝ˜zbaṭu\i 'weasel, squirrel'). PGB \I*ʔɨ˜z-\i would correspond well to PD \I*waca\i < \I*jacʷa,\i but would suggest a PEC (and PNC) form with some medial resonant (most probably \I*jVncwĔ\i).

(where \I*mužǝ\i < \I*bužǝn\i), probably also Khin. (with a similar development) and Lak. (with a regular dropping of the initial syllable beginning with a labial: \Iša-nu\i < \I*wVrša-nu\i). All correspondences are regular (except for some unexpected things within Andian languages, see above) and the PNC reconstruction seems reliable.     Abdokov (1983, 127) compares the Adygh morpheme with PA \I*ʔiš-\i 'home, at  home' (And. \Iišu,\i Botl. \Iiš-q:e,\i Bagv. \Iiša,\i Cham. \Iehi,\i Gig. \Iišu,\i Kar. \Ieše\i - see  Gudava 1964, 116). The Andian root, however, is isolated within EC, as well as  somewhat more remote semantically; the comparison with EC \I*wiršwi\i seems to us  preferable.

Phonetically and semantically quite reliable: the correlation between "dwelling-place, village" and "nest" is usual in Caucasian languages. Some details of reconstruction - e.g., labialisation, allow for alternatives, because the root has preserved not very many reflexes.

Lak. \Iḳa-nu\i (as the similar \Iša-nu\i 'bed' q.v.) is a result of regular dropping of the initial syllable beginning with a labial resonant and containing a narrow vowel (\Iḳa-nu\i < \I*wVḳa-nu\i). The correlation of Av. b-, PA *m-, Lak. *w- (*b-), PL *w- and PWC *P- points to PNC initial *w- and medial *-l- (dropped everywhere, and exceptionally preserved as *-n- in PL). See Abdokov 1983, 90.     The PWC-PEC comparison see in Balkarov 1964, 101; 1967, 117 (the comparison of Av. \Ibaḳ\i with other WC data - Kab. \Ibaq\i 'stable', see Acharyan 1, 907 - is unacceptable). Quite improbable is the inner analysis of the PAK form and its comparison with Kartvelian (PK \I*q̇ana\i 'field'), see Rogava 1956, 20-21.

The Darg. form is reduplicated; since the root is present only in a part of Av.-And. languages and Darg., the vocalic reconstruction for PEC is uncertain.

Engl. \Icuckoo,\i Rus. \Iкукушка,\i PK \I*gugul\i etc.); because of its expressive nature it is hard to make a precise reconstruction. We may note, however, that two basic variants (with *g and with *ḳ) are predominant in most languages. It is also interesting that some expressive suffixes seem to occur in several groups; cf. notably Bacb. \Igugu-ṭṭ,\i PGB \I*kuku-ṭo\i / \I*ḳuḳu-ṭo,\i Darg. \Igegu-t,\i Bud. \Igugu-ṭ.\i See Abdokov 1983, 117.

As for the Av. and Lak. forms, they reflect a result of regular shifts of nasality+labialisation: \I*lɨ̆nƛ̲wē\i > \I*lɨ̆mƛ̲wē\i > \I*mɨ̆ƛ̲wē\i (with subsequent regular loss of initial *mɨ- in Lak.).     The presence of both a lateral resonant *l- and a lateral affricate *ƛ in the root has resulted in a somewhat irregular development of *ƛw here (a week reflex *λʷ in PL, and, to the contrary, a strong x:ʷ in Lak; a delateralised k: in Av.) - the same type of irregularity as in another similar root \I*ƛ̲wĕɫʔĕ\i 'mould, pus' q.v.        See Trubetzkoy 1922, 240.

Cf. Abdokov 1983, 121.     Similar onomatopoeic roots are attested in other languages (cf., e.g., PK \I*ʁuʁun-\i 'to coo').

It usually appears in a reduplicated form: \I*mVq̲̇Vq̇V\i (> Av.), \I*q̲̇VmVq̇V\i ( > Tab.); the PWC form \I*nVbǝʁˊʷV\i can be explained as a secondary dissimilation from \I*mVmǝʁˊʷV\i < \I*mVmVq̲̇V\i (with yet another type of reduplication).     Because of the root's expressive nature, correspondences are obscured and it is impossible to reconstruct anything but a very approximate shape of the original noun.

Like many other birdnames, clearly onomatopoeic (and rather universal, cf. Rus. \Iудод\i etc.); but the correspondences seem to be satisfactory and the reconstruction seems rather probable.

One of the rare cases of an original trisyllabic root structure (which is clearly seen in PA and PL). In Lak. and Darg., as well as in some Lezghian languages, the first weak syllable with a laryngeal was lost, which makes the precise reconstruction of the first vowel impossible. The PA form \I*nus:inHV\i (or \I*ʔuns:inHV\i) is probably a result of assimilation < \I*ʔuns:ilHV\i (~ -rH-). Lak has, besides \Iisu\i 'owl', also (Khosr.) \Is:uli\i 'wild turkey'; because of the irregular reflex s:-, however, it must be considered as a loan (from Darg. or from some Lezg. language).     In spite of phonetic difficulties (caused by the root's trisyllabic character), the overall reconstruction seems quite reliable.
1201|*ɦswǟmV̆|0|a k. of bird (heath-cock, owl)|*māšu|425|*HVnsV|661|*ʔe˜zɔ A ( ~ -z:-)|496||0||0||0||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. Correspondences are regular - except for the accent paradigm in Avar (paradigm C would be expected). This must be explained by supposing contamination of this root with PEC \I*ʔVms̲wĕlʔē\i 'wild turkey' q.v. We must stress that these roots must be kept strictly distinct because of different reflexes of *sw (tense in \I*ʔVms̲wĕlʔē,\i lax in \I*ɦswǟmV̆\i), although they tend to merge due to phonetic and semantic proximity.

The original root must have denoted a medium sized dark bird (cf. various meanings in modern languages: 'blackbird, wild turkey, swallow, pigeon'). Cf. also Hurr. \Izinz-aBǝ\i 'pigeon' (or 'swallow'), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 45.It is interesting to note similar birdnames in Georgian: \Išašvi\i 'blackbird', \Išošia\i 'starling'.

Occasional Inlaut nasalisation (in PTs, PD) may have been caused by old nasal suffixes (cf. some Andian forms).     Several languages may have preserved the root in a non-reduplicated shape: cf. And. \Iq̇:urru,\i Kar. \Iq̇:uru-n,\i Rach. \Iq̇:uru-nṭa\i 'crane' ( = God. \I q̇:ʷaranṭa\i 'a small jug'); Arch. \Iq̇ʷer-ṭi,\i Tab. \Iq̇ar-ni,\i Lezg. Nüt. \Iq:ar-ni\i (with an irregular q:-); Abkh. \Ia-ṗq̇a.\i These forms, although few, seem to indicate a PNC form \I*q̲̇wVrV,\i which may have served as a basis for the more widely spread reduplication \I*q̲̇ǝrǝ̄q̇wV.\i

However, they may also reflect another root, possibly represented in Chech. \Iünṭa-pħid\i 'tortoise', with a tentative protoform \I*HVnṭV.\i The evidence is not sufficient, and this question must still remain open.

Medial *-m- is reconstructed only on basis of the PTs nasalisation, and thus is not very certain. See also \I*ɦwVmṭV\i 'red'.
1212|*tăwc̲V|0|bug||0|*tabc:V|673|*tawsa ( ~ -s:-)|505||0||0||0||0||0|    An And-Tsez. isogloss. Because of a peculiar root-structure in PTs (an unusual -ws- cluster), an old loan in PTsKh from Andian is not excluded.

Because of this reduplication, the cluster "r"+laryngeal did not undergo a usual treatment ( > *-r-, *-0) in PL and PD (however, it gave a usual reflex in PTs).

All languages of Daghestan explicitly reflect the labialised *cw (correspondence Av. c : PA *s : Lak c(ʷ) : PD *s: : PL *-s). The Nakh and PWC forms, however, reflect a simple *c (otherwise PN would have *č, and PWC - *šʷ). The reason is obviously a secondary labialisation in EC, due to the labialising influence of *ʔw (labialisation is also indirectly reflected in PD -m-, assimilated from -n-). The root must have contained both a nasal (cf. forms like PN \I*nace,\i Lak. \Inuwca,\i PD \I*ʕems:,\i Arch. \Iwinisi\i) and a liquid resonant (cf. PA \I*risV\i and most Lezghian forms). However, a disyllabic protoform \I*ʔwnĭrcĔ\i or \I*ʔwrĭncĔ\i would give quite different reflexes in most languages (see phonetic tables). We must, therefore, suppose a protoform like \I*ʔwinĭrcĔ\i to account for all the complexity of development. The trisyllabic Archi form \Iwinisi\i thus appears to be an archaism, directly reflecting the PNC root structure.     The root as such is not reflected in PTs (we should expect something like \I*rizV\i or \I*rɨzV\i). There exists, however, a PC root \I*rɨcV(nV\i) (Tsez. \Irecenjo,\i Gin. \Irecen\i 'ant', Bezht. \Irica,\i Gunz. \Irɨcǝ\i 'tick'). It can be an indirect reflex of the same EC root, modified under the influence of other insect names like PTs \I*nɔcǝ\i 'louse' or \I*hu˜cV\i 'ant'.

The etymology is not very certain, because there is much confusion within the Lezghian reflexes, and we have only dialectal (not very secure) recordings in Av. and Lak. In other EC languages there exists also a number of words, close to this root, but very aberrant phonetically: cf. And. (Khaid.) \Ic:uṭa\i 'dung-beetle', Gunz. (Khaid.) \Ic̣ǝda\i 'beetle', Darg. \Ic̣uzdagi\i ( < \I*c̣ut:-\i ?) id. Cf. also Av. \Ioˊcħuṭ\i 'dung-beetle', possibly also belonging here, but folk-etymologically transformed (meaning literally "ox-worm" in modern Avar).

An obvious NC (probably WC) loan is Osset. \Ibɨnʒ\i / \Ibinʒä\i 'fly' (see Abayev 1958, 280 with dubious etymological attempts). Comparison of PWC and Nakh see in Meˊszaˊros 1934, 227, Dumeˊzil 1963, 15; Abdokov (1983, 113) adds also some Lezg. data.

In PTs we would rather expect *-r-; this must be a rare case of *r/l variation in PGB (this feature is much more common in PTsKh). However, despite this, it seems impossible to separate the PTs form from the PA and PN.
1221|*sindV (~ -ä-)|1312|a k. of insect||0|*sindV|681|*zidɔ A|513||0||0||0||0||0|    An Av.-And.-Tsez. isogloss. One is tempted to compare Ub. \Išˊāˊnṭa\i 'bug', but the correspondences between \I*sindV\i and \Išˊāˊnṭa\i are absolutely irregular; thus (unless this is a case of heavy irregular change in an expressive root), it should be better kept apart. Bouda (1960, 125) and Abdokov (1983, 125) compare the Ub. form with the reflexes of EC \I*cˊ̲wVṭV\i 'biting insect' (q.v.) - which, unfortunately, is as irregular as the other solution.

Most languages reflect an intermediate form \I*q̲̇äqwĭ\i (with metathesized labialization); Av.-And. languages also reflect a shift of tenseness (\I*q̇:ʷiḳa\i < \I*q̇ʷiḳ:a\i which would be normally expected). We should note also a form, aberrant phonetically, but possibly also belonging here: Bezht. (Khosh.) \Iq̇imaq̇o\i 'spider'.

All EC languages reflect an expressive reduplicated form; reduplication was probably favoured by the existence of several semantically close reduplicated insect names (see \I*cīmc̲V,\i \I*c̣ĕlc̣ŭ,\i \I*c̣ˊimVc̣ˊV\i et al.). Otherwise correspondences are regular.     It is, perhaps, possible to find the non-reduplicated stem within EC in Tind. \Imic:u-q̇u\i 'tick' (presupposing PA \I*mic̣:V-q̇:u;\i Andian loanwords are Inkh. \Imic̣iq̇u,\i Tsez. \Imic̣iq̇u\i 'tick').

Abdokov (1983, 122) compares the Abkh. form with reflexes of PEC  \I*ʔw(i)nĭrcE\ĭ 'moth' (q.v.), which is hardly possible for phonetic reasons.

Although this is an expressive reduplicated root, and not widely spread, the reconstruction seems reliable (we should at any rate distinguish it from several other phonetically close roots like \I*ʒ̲imiʒĕ,\i \I*cīmc̲V\i etc.).

It is hard to establish whether the original meaning was 'bee' (preserved only in Lak.) or 'sweet' (and 'bee' in Lak. metaphorically as 'sweet-maker'). One of the rare cases of the root structure *HRVHV. In PL (Tab.) m- is the result of secondary labialisation (\I*neHwV-\i > \I*meHwV-\i).

Although not widely represented outside the Av.-And. area, the root seems quite reliable both phonetically and semantically.     It is interesting to note the root's full homonymousness with PNC \I*nHäƛ̣̲wV\i 'blue' (q.v.): perhaps it had meant originally "a blue (or green) insect".

Inspite of some phonetic variation (especially irregular is the PTs form), it seems worth reconstructing for PNC.

Correspondences are regular (although n- in Av. is not quite clear; we would rather expect r-, as in Andian languages). Labialisation of *c̣w in word-final position was early lost in PN and PL, but has left clear traces in Av.-And.-Tsez.
1238|*ʡăɫV|81|branch||0|*ħala ( ~ o)|700|*ʔalV|519||0||0||0||0||0|    An And.-Tsez. isogloss. There are no certain parallels in other languages. However, there is an interesting possibility of comparing PL \I*ʔala\i 'weed', possibly represented in Tsakh. \Iala\i id. The Tsakh. word seems to be, at first sight (together with Kryz. \Ialaʁ\i and Khin. \Ialaʁ\i id.) an Azerb. loan (Azerb. \IalaG\i 'weed'); however, within Turkic the root is purely Azeri (it is not attested even in Turkish), so it may itself be a Caucasian loanword.

Note that Lak. > Darg. \Iwac̣a\i 'forest' (otherwise we would expect ħ- or b- in Darg.). See Bouda 1948 (Lak-WC). We should stress that PWC \I*mazˊV\i is a genuine root, and has nothing to do with the Iranian root \I*nauča-\i 'a pine-like cypress' (Pers. \Ināǯū\i 'pine-tree', \Inōǯ\i 'cypress', Osset. \Inaz/nazu\i 'fir-tree', \Inäzǝ/näzi\i 'pine-tree', whence Georg. \Inaʒvi\i 'fir-tree', Megr. \Inuʒu\i id.).

The non-palatalized second *c: in PWC is due to assimilation (in a reduplicated stem; otherwise we would rather expect \I*c:āʒˊV\i). See Trubetzkoy 1930, 276 (with a probably wrong WC etymology, see  under \I*ʔăjʒăɫʔV\i), Abdokov 1983, 113 (basically correct, but with many  superfluous EC forms).     There is a similar root in Kartvelian: PK \I*ʒeʒw-\i 'blackthorn, thorny plant' (see Klimov 1964, 234-235, 1971, 229-230; Klimov, however, attracts quite different WC data, namely, PWC \I*ǯa\i 'cornel' or PWC \I*dˊʷVdˊʷV\i 'awl' - both in fact having other EC parallels). There are also similar forms in Iranian languages (Osset. \Izaz\i 'yew', Pers. \Ižāž\i 'a k. of thorn' et al. - see Abayev 1989, 289 - but despite Abayev, the Iranian source of all these forms is highly dubious).

The root originally must have meant "asp-tree" or "poplar"; in Andian and Lezghian it changed its meaning to "birch" - obviously under the influence of PEC \I*mħĕrqwĕ\i q.v.

The Lak. form \Ihi\i goes back regularly to \I*mihi\i (with a regular reduction of initial *m- + narrow vowel). The meaning "birch" in PTs and Lak is due to the influence of another root, PEC \I*mħĕrqwĕ\i 'birch', which itself was not preserved in these languages (on the origin of Lak. dialectal \Imaq\i 'birch' see under \I*mħĕrqwĕ\i).     Although the roots \I*mħĕrqwĕ\i and \I*mĭhV\i appear to be in complementary distribution, there is no way to unite them phonetically, and they must be treated as separate etyma (the former meaning "birch", the latter, probably, "alder").

It is hard to establish the precise meaning in PNC: the only obvious fact is that the root denoted some kind of a foliage tree, which was often used for construction purposes (cf. the meanings in Tsezian and Lezghian languages) and probably resembled a peach-tree (cf. the meaning in Av.).     See Abdokov 1983, 109 (Akhv. : Kab.; Chech. \Ilag,\i also cited by the author,  has no relation to the present root).

Note that neither of three similar roots used for "oak-tree" in Tsezian languages (\I*moqV/*noqV,\i \I*niχV\i and \I*moh\i) can reflect PEC \I*mħŏq̲we,\i and all of them have, in fact, different EC etymologies (see \I*mĕlG̲wɨ,\i \I*nīχ̲V\i and \I*mǝ̆hwV\i).     In the Darg-Lezg. area the root \I*mħŏq̲we\i also is used as a second part in a compound meaning 'small nut' (PD \I*s:il-mik:ʷ\i > Ak., Ur. \Isirmug,\i Kub. \Is:il-mik:(ʷ)a\i, Kharb. plur. \Isirmuk:ʷe,\i Tsud., Muir. \Isirmuk;\i PL > Tab. Düb. \IhalmuqI,\i Kand. \IamluqI,\i Lezg. \Išümäʁ\i); the first part of the compound is not quite clear.     Abdokov (1983, 111) compares the EC forms with PAK \I*qʷa-\i in \I*qʷaħǝ\i 'boat,  ship' (Ad. \Iqʷǝħa,\i Bzhed. \Iqʷāħǝ,\i Kab. \Iqʷǝħ\i) and \I*qʷa-sʷaˊ\i (Ad. \Iqʷāsˊʷa,\i Kab.  \Iqʷāfa\i) id., as well as PAT \I*maqʷǝ-da\i 'bough, branch'. While theoretically  possible, this comparison is semantically dubious, and the loss of *m- in PAK  is hard to explain.

PEC *-di is a suffix, frequently present in plant names. It is possible that this *-di is originally an oblique base marker (note the frequent usage of tree names in a construction "X's tree" = "tree X").

Abdokov  (1983, 112) compares the WC form with reflexes of EC \I*rĕxwV\i 'stick, wood'  (q.v.) (with some confusion of this root and \I*rä̆sˊwĒ\i 'wood, beam').  Phonetically both comparisons are acceptable, but ours seems to us somewhat  better semantically.

One feels tempted to compare PWC > PAK \I*(p)c:aLǝ\i 'willow' (Ad. \IpceLǝ,\i Kab. \IʒaL\i), but there are significant phonetic obstacles (PAK *c: can go back to PWC *č:, but we would rather expect *č̣ˊʷ- in Anlaut). Thus the root so far remains an Av.-Lezg. isogloss.

Phonetically rather complicated, because of numerous assimilations/dissimilations of *q- and *-x-; in the Darg.-Lezg. area the case is still more complicated: several languages and dialects reflect a variant \I*qäwƛ̣̲V\i \I(*q̲äƛ̣wV),\i being a result of merger of \I*qäwx̲wV\i and \I*ʔwǟrƛ̣̲V\i 'nut' (q.v.). Nevertheless, a good correlation between most Av., Lak., Darghian and Lezghian forms allows us to suggest the reconstruction \I*qäwx̲wV\i with reasonable certainty.        Not quite clear is the relationship of the EC form and PK \I*(s̥1̇)tχil-\i 'small nut' (see Климов 1965, 177). We should note that Georgian \Itχili\i 'nut' (going back to that root) was the source of some superficially similar EC forms: cf. Av. Chad. \Iqilu\i 'nut', Bezht., Gunz. \Iχili\i id.

A very widely spread common NC root. The PWC form has a frequent prefixed *b(V)-. The original meaning could have been not "apple", but "medlar" (cf. the semantic correspondence between PN and PWC), with later semantic change (medlars look very much like small apples). Note that PN \I*ʡāǯ\i 'apple' should be quite definitely kept apart (PN *ǯ can not be derived from *cˊ in any possible way); see \I*HV̄ǯwĔ.\i     Despite Abdokov 1983, 110 the PEC forms can not be related to PWC \I*mIa\i  'apple'.
1268|*ɣōnʡV|785|pear|*ʁam-maʁa|259|*hinhV|730|*hi˜|544||0||0||0||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. The PN form is a compound < \I*ʁan\i + \I*paʁa\i (about the second part see PEC \I*pĭrq̲wA\i). It is interesting to note a form, isolated within Andian: Akhv. \Imaχ:aχ:o\i 'pear', very much resembling the PN \I*ʁammaʁa\i (but obviously not related genetically, because there is no correspondence between PN *ʁ and PA *χ:). This may be an old loanword from Nakh (with χ: reflecting the PN *ʁ - probably before the original *G changed to *ʁ in PA).

The correspondences between PEC and PWC, in what concerns the timbre features, are regular in any case (note the palatalisation + labialisation in PWC, which can correspond both to *ü and to *qw + *e in PEC). In PWC, however, we would expect a form like \I*q:ˊʷa\i (with tense *q:) corresponding to a long vowel in PEC. This discrepancy is still to be explained, but of course it does not make the comparison less valid.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 276, Abdokov 1983, 105.     There is also a possible (but very problematic) Kartvelian parallel: Georg. \I(m)sχali\i, Megr. \Isχuli,\i Chan. \Icχuli,\i Svan. \Iicχi\i 'pear' (see Charaya 1912, 26; Gudava 1954, 706-707).
1270|*HV̄ǯwĔ|0|apple|*ʡāǯ|468||0||0||0||0||0||0|*žˊʷǝ|383|    An exclusive Nakh-WC isogloss, thus there is not enough information to reconstruct laryngeals and vocalism.

Despite some expressive transformations, correspondences are basically regular and the root seems reliable.     The root was borrowed into Kumyk from some Caucasian language: Kum. \Ikurägä\i 'apricot', whence it was loaned back into some EC languages (Tsez., Gin., Bezht., Gunz. \Ikurak,\i Darg. Chir. \Iqurek:a\i 'apricot') and Russian (\Iкурага\i).
1272|*q̇VrčĂ|0|peach||0|*q̇určV|732||0||0|*q̇urč|426||0||0|*q̇ǝča|384|    Not quite clear is the loss of labialisation in PAK; otherwise correspondences between PEC and PWC are regular, and the reconstruction seems generally plausible (of course, if we dismiss secondary contaminations and mergers in the WC area).

Correspondences are regular, except for the excessive -n- in PD (all other languages reveal absolutely no trace of any medial resonant); it may have penetrated from an oblique base like \I*ʔaq-nV-\i (or, more probably be a result of contamination with another root: PEC \I*HēnqwV\i 'meadow, plot' q.v.).

As usual in roots with two stops, there occur metatheses of laryngeal features (PL \I*k:[ɨ]ṭ\i < \I*ḳ[ɨ]t:\i). The medial -r-in Andian is probably secondary (\I*ḳʷordo\i < \I*ḳʷodV-rV,\i cf. the PN form). Since there are problems with the PL vocalism, the PEC vocalic reconstruction is also not clear. Despite this, the etymology seems generally plausible.

The root must have originally meant 'kernel, fruit-stone', whence, on the one hand, meanings like "grape", "plum" and "peach", on the other hand - "marrow".     Klimov (1964, 181) marks the similarity of PN \I*ṭum\i with Kartvelian \I*ṭwin-\i "brain"; it is most probable that the Kartvelian root is an old loanword from NC.

The long root structure, of course, is in Caucasian languages very favourable for metatheses, which we observe here in many cases.      We can also mention a quite alone-standing form: Khin. \Iḳinaz\i 'grape'. It resembles most the Nakh forms (especially Bacb.), and may be a trace of old Khin.-Nakh contacts. Also borrowed from some neighbour languages (with distortions) are probably some words for 'strawberry' in Andian languages: Cham. \Iq:ermužuq̇:\i (Gig. \Iq:erbuši\i), Inkh. \Iχilbač.\i {The word is found also in Arab. and Berber, see ND 945}.

See Abdokov 1983, 112.     Hurrian in Arraphe had a word \I*šann-orǝ\i 'plum-(tree), medlar' ( > Akkad. \Išannūru,\i perhaps also Sum. \Išennur\i id.), which can be compared with EC \I*swɨ̆nē.\i Other dialects, however, had \I*šall-orǝ\i ( > Akkad. \Išallūru,\i Arm. \Isalor\i) with a secondary -l- (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 34).     The Caucasian word (with the meaning 'grapes' > 'wine') penetrated into Scythian \I*sana,\i Osset. \Isän\i / \Isänä\i (despite Abayev 1979, 67, the Indo-Iranian origin of the word is highly dubious). Note that usually this root is confused with PNC \I*ʒˊw[ǝ̆]nʔi\i 'honey, wine' (q.v.) - etymologically quite different.

"mint" in PL and PN, "hay" in PD, "sweetbrier" in PN), but it is hard to guess the particular species. The comparison involves some metatheses which are only natural in a trisyllabic stem like this.     Ultimately the stem can be derived from PNC \I*HmĭɦwV\i 'smell, odour' q.v., but it certainly already existed separately in PEC.     The stem was borrowed in some other Caucasian languages: Osset. \Inūrɨ\i 'garlic', Georg. \Iniori,\i Svan. \Iniwra\i id. (see Abayev 1973, 193).

Still, the PWC form rather belongs here than to PEC \I*ʕä̆mcˊō\i 'medlar, apple' q.v. (despite Trubetzkoy 1930, 276).
1281|*ǯɦŭmV|475|bush, grass; a k. of fruit|*ǯʡŏlVm ( ~ -ă-)|473|*žumi / *žimi|738|*žumal ( ~ š-, š:-)|552|žunaw|445|*č:unab|431|*ǯuIm ( ~ -o-)|808||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. Several subgroups reflect a PEC derivate \I*ǯɦŭmV-ɫV\i (sometimes, with metathesis > \I*ǯɦŭɫVmV\i). Because of a specific and identical metathesis of nasality, it is highly probable that either the Darg. forms are borrowed from Lak., or vice versa - although it is difficult now to establish the direction of loan. The form \I*ǯɦŭɫVmV\i (or \I*ǯɦŭɫVm-bV,\i with a plural suffix) is attested already in Hurr. \Izilumba\i 'date of the Phoenix dactylifera' (whence it was borrowed into Sum. \Izulum(m)a\i, Akkad. \Isuluppu\i, see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 41).     Despite Khaidakov 1973, Kum. \Ičum\i 'berry, cornel' can not be the source of Caucasian forms (although it is a probable source of the isolated And. (cited from ibid.) \Ičum\i 'cornel'). Within Turkic the root is known only in modern Kumyk, Balkar and Turkmani, thus with high probability is itself borrowed from some Caucasian (or closely related) language. Caucasian origin is also quite probable for Osset. \Icɨm\i / \Icumä\i 'cornel' (see Abayev 1958, 321).

We must note some interlingual loans: 1) since the Lak and Darg. (Chir.) forms have an identical reduplication, it is probable that one of them borrowed from another (probably Darg. < Lak., since the form is known only in the Chirag dialect of Darg.); 2) Archi has a word \Imam\i 'raspberry', usually in the combination \Igʷac:ilin mam\i (lit. "mare's nipple"). It is probable that Archi borrowed the Lak. form \Imamar(i\i) and reinterpreted the -ar(i) part as the plural suffix, thus building a neologism mam (coinciding phonetically with mam 'nipple, breast' which is of course quite coincidental).      A form like PN \I*mur-iḳ\i (\I*mor-iḳ\i), reflected in Chech. \Imürg,\i was probably the source of Osset. \Imurḳä\i 'guelderrose', further - Ad. \Imarāḳʷa,\i Kab. \Imārḳʷa\i 'strawberry, blackberry', Ub. \Imǝ(r)ḳˊa-\i id., Abaz. \Imaraḳʷa\i 'mulberry', Balk. \Imarako\i 'strawberry' etc. This direction of borrowing is probable because in PN the element -iḳ is easily recognized as a suffix.     See Abayev 1973, 141; Shagirov 1, 266 with literature.

Lak. u regularly < \I*muʔu\i (with loss of initial *m + narrow vowel). In many languages the root means a special sort of barley ("голозерный ячмень"), which must have been the original meaning or close to it. Note also the existance of a PEC derivate \I*wVlq̇V̄-nV\i 'flour made of young (barley) sprouts'; besides PD \I*nuq̇un\i and Tsakh. (Mishl.) \Iuq̇un\i it is reflected in Lak. \Iini\i ( < \I*muʔV-ni\i) id., cf. especially Lak. \Iu ini\i ( < \I*muʔu *muʔV-ni)\i 'flour from young barley sprouts'.

Abdokov  (1983, 106) compares the EC root with PAK \I*ʁa-\i (in compounds like \I*ʁa-zʷaˊ\i  'crops'), but Shagirov (1, 123) is probably right in identifying this element  with PAK \I*ʁa\i 'season, time'.

Besides all the loans from one language into another pointed out above, it is also not excluded that Av. \Iniχa,\i Lak. \IniIq(ʷ)a\i and Darg. \IniqIa\i also were borrowed (in fact, it seems rather probable that both Av. and Lak. forms are early loanwords from Proto-Darg.: since the word seemingly had a short front Auslaut vowel, Lak. and Av. -a is irregular. At least, such a possibility must be reckoned with).     Nevertheless, if we exclude all possible loanwords from one language into another, the root is still there: the Akhv., PTs, PD, PL and PWC forms could not have been borrowed. Thus, the reconstruction of the root for PNC seems very probable. The proposed comparison seems to us better than relating the WC root  to EC \I*mūqV\i 'barley' (q.v.), see Balkarov 1975, 79, Abdokov 1983, 108; these  two authors prefer to compare EC reflexes of \I*ħnǟrqwĔ\i with Ad. \Izantχ(ǝ\i)  'oats'. The latter is a rather obscure stem, with unclear morphological and  phonetic structure (attested also in Svan. \Izantχ\i and Osset. \Izäntχä\i), and  should be better kept apart.

However, the root \I*bagǝna\i "oats" is undoubtedly genuine (it is hard to suppose a semantic shift "beer" > "oats").     If we consider *-na in the WC form a later addition, under the influence of the mentioned root \I*bagǝna\i "beverage, beer", the PWC \I*bagǝ\i ( ~ -gˊ-) will be a regular reflex of PNC \I*ɦwVgǝbV̆\i ~ * \IɦwVbǝgV̆.\i

A variant of the same root is, perhaps, reflected in Cham. \Iʁoc:\i "rye" ( presupposing PA \I*ʁʷič:V\i); reflexes of both consonants are, however, irregular, and we should perhaps think of it as an old loanword (from some related language). The Cham. (*Tind.-Cham.) form was, in its turn, borrowed in Inkh. \Iʁuč\i 'rye'.

In the reduplicated form (\I*sūls̲ūli\i), which is of course common EC, there occurred different assimilations (in PA: \I**sus:ur\i > \I*susur;\i on PTs see above; in Lak. \I*sus:-\i > \Isus;\i in PD \I*suls:ul\i > \I*s:u(l)s:ul\i, and likewise in PL - although we must say that in PL also \I*solsol\i or \I*s:ols:ol\i may be reconstructed; evidence for *s: is present only in the non-reduplicated stem \I*s:ol\i).     The root is also widely spread in Turkic, Mongolian, Fenno-Ugric and Kartvelian languages (see Abayev 1979, 194). Abayev (ibid.) suggests that its original source was somewhere in Central Asia. However, the time of its appearance in the Caucasus is not clear, and correspondences between languages strongly suggest its archaic character (of course if we exclude obvious late loans like the isolated Chech. \Isula\i 'oat' < Osset. \Isyl\i or Georg. \Isvila\i). It is interesting that only in EC languages (not in Turkic or any other mentioned above) there exists a reduplicated stem (which obviously was the source of Osset. \Isysyly\i 'a k. of weed'). Summing up, the root is obviously a "Wanderwort"; but it is evidently very ancient on Caucasian ground.     See Bokarev 1961, 60; Лексика 1971, 167.

The PWC form has a frequent prefixed *p- (with usual labial dissimilation after it: *-šˊʷ- > *-šˊ-).     The Avar form, which is phonetically quite regular, but somewhat deviating semantically, may have been influenced by another root, whose traces are left in PN \I*ča\i 'straw' (Chech., Ing. \Iča,\i Bacb. \Iča-l\i) and possibly in Bud. \Ičeʕ\i 'roasted grain'.

The regular reflex of \I*mūqV\i in PTs is \I*miχV;\i thus another root, PTsKh \I*maqa\i 'barley' (Tsez., Gin., Inkh. \Imaqa\i) must be considered as a loanword. The most probable source for it is Proto-Kartvelian \I*maqa\i ( ~ -χ-); see Klimov 1964, 130 about this root, which itself can be a loanword from some PEC dialect.

The AK-EC comparison was first put forward by Balkarov (1964, 100).

A very stable and regular root, which is probably explained by the importance of nettle in the East Caucasian household (it is frequently added to all kinds of food).     Abdokov (1983, 108) compares the EC root with PAK \I*pča-sanǝ\i / \I*pča-sǝranǝ\i  'nettle'; the word is rather obscure, and the phonetic correspondence between  EC and WC is irregular, so this etymology should rather be rejected.

In the Darg-Lezg. area there exists a stem denoting 'garlic' - \I*swälgV\i - which can be probably traced back to the same root (if we assume that -gV is a suffix here, possibly, deglottalized from diminutive *-ḳV), cf. Darg. Chir. \Is:urge\i 'garlic'; PL \I*s(:)älk:\i > Lezg. \Iserg\i (erg. \Iserk:i\i), Ag. \Iserg,\i Kryz. \Isarg\i 'garlic', Bud. \Isǝrg\i 'ramson' (-l- is indicated by the fact of preservation of -r- in Kryz. and Bud.; real *-r- would have been lost in this position).

Perhaps we should also relate to this root Lak. \Ijaj\i 'a k. of grass' (пажитник) and Khin. \Ijenje-č\i 'caraway' (if these forms can be traced to an intermediate structure *HinHV < *HimHV).     The root \I*HmĭɦwV\i probably served as basis for deriving PEC \I*miɦwVrV\i 'a k. of odorous grass' (q.v.), which perhaps in this case should be reconstructed as \I*HmĭɦwV-rV.\i     See Abdokov 1983, 98 (containing also a suggestion of a possible  etymological connection between \I*HmĭɦwV\i 'smell' and PEC \I*mɨ̆ɦwVlV\i 'nose'  q.v.).

Although the root is attested only in three languages, correspondences are regular and the reconstruction seems probable. Cf. also Hurr. \Išaɣri\i 'orchard' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 36).
1343|*kiɫū|795|farmstead; hut||0|*kilV|782||0||0||0||0||0|*kˊalV|409|    An Aand-WC isogloss. However, the correspondences are quite regular (both phonetically and semantically), and the NC antiquity of the root seems very probable. See Abdokov 1983, 127 (although with some confusion between this  root and PEC \I*ŁwĕɫV\i 'fence' q.v. - which should be carefully distinguished).       Since there is some semantic connection between 'house' and 'hearth'  (cf., e.g. PEC \I*ɦnărG̲wī\i), one feels tempted to compare Ag. \Ikilaˊj-ar\i 'hearth'  (a plur. tantum). The word is, however, isolated within Lezghian and this hypothesis still is to be proved.

All other parallels suggested for the PWC form meet serious phonetic obstacles (Trubetzkoy's [1930, 278] comparison with Chech. \Iben\i 'nest' etc.; Lomtatidze's [1955] comparison with Old Georg. \Isaq̇udeli,\i Megr. \Iʕude,\i Av. \Iruq̇:\i 'house'; Abdokov's [1983, 133] comparison with obvious late loanwords like Gunz. \Ibina\i 'building' etc.). The Georgian form \Iwani\i 'house, dwelling', cited by Charaya (1912) and Bouda (1950) is most probably an Adygh loan.

Cf. Trubetzkoy 1922, 239 (for EC); Abdokov 1983, 128-129.
1346|*χwōrɦV (/*rɦōχwV)|797|village, farmstead||0|*riχ:ʷV-|785||0||0||0|*χIora|858||0||0|    An Aand-Lezg. isogloss. Except for metathesis (rather a frequent feature), all correspondences are regular.     An interesting form is Arch. \Iduχ:ur\i 'farmstead': this is probably an old loanword from Av.-And. with a later Arch. change r- > d- (\Iduχ:ur\i < \I*riχ:ʷV-r\i), thus constituting an etymological doublet with Arch. \IχIor\i 'village'.

See Абдоков 1983, 186. The Kartvelian data compared with PWC by Lomtatidze 1955 (Georg. \Imʁʷime\i 'cavern', \Iʁru\i 'hollow', Old Georg. \Iqureli\i 'hole') are heterogeneous and probably do not belong here. On the other hand, cf. PK \I*ʁele-\i 'ravine' which may be borrowed from \I*G̲wǝ̆lʡi.\i

Some languages (some Darg. dialects, Khin.) reflect suffixed forms (with *-bV and *-dV, originally probably plural or collective).     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 242 (with some confusion of \I*Ł̲ēmV\i and \I*ƛ̣̲ǝrHV\i   q.v.). The same confusion is present in Abdokov 1983, 128, who also tries to  compare PAK \I*λamǝˊǯǝ\i 'bridge'. However, the morphological structure of the  Adygh form is not clear (see Shagirov 1, 250), and the correspondence EC *Ł̲ :  WC *λ is irregular, so this comparison should be rejected.

The meanings 'bridge' and 'roof, cover' overlap several times in EC languages, thus the Khinalug word meaning 'lid, cover' is a 'bridge' between PL 'bridge' and PA 'eye-lid' ( < *'cover'). Nevertheless, the etymology is still not very reliable - first of all because within Andian the word is attested only in Akhvakh.     The reconstructed form \I*ħG̲unu\i is rather close phonetically to PNC \I*Hǝ̆G̲wĔ(n\i)- 'to cover, close' (q.v.). We may either assume an old (PEC) derivation, or a secondary influence of the verbal root.

It is interesting to mention Tind. \Iq:awu\i 'garret': it is quite isolated within Andian, and can not correspond phonetically to PL \I*q:aw\i (Tind. \IʁabV\i would be expected) - perhaps it should be regarded as a loan from some Lezghian language (although we do not know of any other cases of early Lezghian loanwords in Andian languages).

(Chir. \Iq̇aj\i 'thing'), where it is most probably borrowed from Lak. or Avar; however, the Lak., PTs and Av.-And. forms are probably genetically related and not borrowed from each other (Lak. - because of initial labialisation which would be inexplicable if it were an Av. loan; Tsez. forms - because of the semantic discrepancy).     If the original EC meaning was 'house, household', the word could be  compared with PAK \I*ʡʷa\i (presupposing PWC \I*q̇ˊʷa\i) 'yard, enclosure (for  cattle)' ( > Ad., Kab. \Iʡʷa\i). Abdokov (1983, 128) compares the AK root with  \I*q̲̇ʷĭndǝ\i 'wall' (q.v.), which is very dubious for phonetic reasons.

Cf., perhaps, also Darg. Murg. (Musayev) \Iq:inda-la lag\i 'a steep rise' ( \Ilag\i 'rise'), if it can mean 'a rise, (steep like) a wall'. In this case we would have a PD form \I*q:int:a\i or \I*q:inda,\i which could reflect the same root if we suppose an assimilation \I*q:int:a\i < \I*q̇int:a.\i

See Dumeˊzil 1933, 50, Abdokov 1983, 133.
1359|*kăuV̄|945|gate, fence|*kaw (~ -b)|516|*kawV|793||0||0||0||0||0|*kawǝ|415|    The PNC antiquity of this root is rather dubious. It is nearly identical in all languages (and the probability of interlingual borrowing is rather high), refers to a cultural phenomenon, and is widely represented outside the North Caucasian languages: cf. Georg. (dial.) \Ikawi\i 'fence, fortress' (probably an Adygh loanword), Osset. \Ikaw\i / \Ikawä\i 'fence', Hung. \Ikaˊva\i id., Mord. \Ikav\i 'closet, cage', Veps. \Ikavi\i 'stake', Russ. (Novgor., Olon.) \Iкава,\i \Iкаба\i id. See Шагиpов 1977, Abdokov 1983, 127, Aбаев 1949, 1958, Фасмеp 1967.     Rogava (1956) and Kumakhov (1964) may be right in treating PAK \I*kaˊwǝ\i as a derivate from \I*kǝ\i 'twig, rod'. In this case the Adygh form is a probable source of all the above forms, and the form \I*kău̲V̄\i should be considered non-existent.

The PWC form has a frequent labial prefix (with a usual in this case delabialisation of the following consonant). The comparison seems reliable, both phonetically and semantically (an alternative comparison of  Adygh forms with PEC \I*mōnqī\i 'breast' - see Abdokov 1983, 79 - is improbable  for phonetic reasons).     It seems possible to compare also Lak. Khosr. \Iq̇alaq̇u\i 'lid, cover' which is either a reduplication or a reflex of the same compound with \I*ƛ̣a-\i 'above' (if \Iq̇alaq̇u\i < \I*ḳalaq̇u\i through assimilation).

One could also compare Gunz. \Ibɔḳi\i 'enclosure for cattle'; there is, however, a possibility of its being borrowed from Georgian: cf. Georg. \Ibaḳi,\i Zan. \Ibaḳi\i 'enclosure for cattle' (compared by Kuipers 1960 with Kab. \Ibaq\i 'enclosure', which is phonetically improbable).

The word originally meant 'hinge' (cf. the Laki form), passing to "door-hinge" and "door" in other languages.     Abdokov (1983, 131-132) compares the EC forms with Kab. \I-sˊ̣ǝ-\i in  \Iwǝ-sˊ̣ǝ-n\i 'to open, open wide', \Ixʷa-sˊ̣ǝ-n\i 'to close, shut'. The root is  probably connected with Ad. \I-č̣ˊǝ-\i in \Iza-ʡʷǝ-č̣ˊǝ-n,\i \Iq:ǝ-ʡʷǝ-č̣ˊǝ-n\i 'to open  (intr.)' and thus allows to reconstruct PAK \I*č̣ˊǝ-.\i The phoneme *č̣ˊ theoretically  can go back to PWC lateral *ƛ̣ˊʷ, thus allowing for a remote chance of  relationship with the EC root; however, it seems much more probable that  together with Ub. \Ič̣ˊa-\i (in \Ič̣ˊa-tʷ-\i 'to close', \Ič̣ˊa-ṭʷ-\i 'to open') it goes back  to a quite separate WC protoform \I*č̣ˊV\i 'to open / close'.

The original quality of the Inlaut consonant (*-k-) is probably retained in PL, and *-ḳ- in PN and PTs must be explained by assimilation; otherwise the correspondences are regular.     Abayev (1958, 295) proposes a Caucasian origin for Osset. \Icäg\i 'ring, chain link'.

PN has a regular -r- before the diminutive *-iḳ; -r in Bacb. \Iʕür\i is probably an analogical back-formation (or a result of merger with PN \I*ōr\i 'pit', see below).    The Avar word may be alternatively compared with PN \I*ōr\i 'pit' (Chech. \Ior,\i obl. \Iōra-,\i Ing. \Ior\i); a borrowing Nakh < Avar is also not excluded. However, Abayev (1989, 95) is certainly wrong in supposing that Chech., Av. \Ior\i is borrowed from Osset. \Iwärm\i 'pit, cellar' (a word of Iranian origin, borrowed in Georg. \Iormo\i).

The root has no class prefixes in PN, and their traces in PTs are probably secondary (initial *ʔw reinterpreted as the animated class marker). Medial *-χ- in PTs is not quite regular (we would rather expect -χ:- or -ʁ:-): this is possibly due to contamination with another EC root, \I*ʡĭnGwV̆\i 'heel, back' (q.v.).     The root is sometimes hard to distinguish from \I*-ǝ̆χA\i 'below' (q.v.), but they are opposed at least in PN and PA and should be kept separate.

See Абдоков 1983, 181-182.

A NC source is probable for Osset. \Ikʷɨroj\i / \Ikurojnä\i 'mill' (the Indo-European etymology of it is hardly possible, see Abayev 1958, 612).

In [Diakonoff -Starostin 1986, 48] the root is compared with Hurr. \IkaruBǝ\i 'granary'; it is possible, but somewhat dubious because of the -i-vocalism in PEC.

In PN the 1st syllable was reduced, and the laryngeal transferred into Inlaut, which conditioned a non-trivial development of *ʒ in the cluster. Nevertheless, the etymology seems rather probable.     A similar form exists in Tsez. (\Imecra\i 'enclosure for milking sheep'), but the nature of the initial m- here is quite obscure (the rest corresponds well to the PL form).

The medial resonant is reconstructed to account for spirantization in PTs; without it one would expect a reflex \I*beč.\i The loss of *-r- in a cluster in Chech. and Av. is normal.

Abdokov (1983, 125) compares the Kab. form with heterogeneous EC material (Darg. \Idirq,\i Tab. \IaqI\i) which is hardly justified.

The medial resonant -r- is reconstructed because of the correspondence PA *-χ:- : PTs *ʁ: (without the resonant we would expect *-χ- in PA); unfortunately, languages which could have preserved the -r-, have not preserved the root.

Most languages also reflect the common EC derivate \I*hwmĭʒū\i 'honey' (in some of the modern languages reflexes of these two roots later merged or influenced each other, see above).     The EC-WC comparison see Абдоков 1983, 149. It seems probable, but there are reservations: if the WC form is really related, one must reconstruct \I*mĭʒ̲ŭ\i with a short final vowel (opposed to -ū in \I*hwmĭʒ̲ū\i 'honey'); also unclear are the reasons for dropping *m- in PWC.

The Botl. and God. forms can not be separated from Kar. and Bagv.; thus  their separate treatment as being related to PWC \I*šˊ:ʷa\i 'fat, oil' (see  Abdokov 1983, 85) is absolutely unacceptable.

Other attempts of comparison for the WC form (either with Georg. \Irʒe,\i Svan. \Ilǝǯe\i 'milk' - see Charaya 1912, 41, or with Chech. \Išura,\i And. \Iš:iwu\i 'milk', Cham. \Is:ara\i 'sour milk' [let us note that these forms have also nothing to do with each other] etc. - see Trubetzkoy 1930, 85; Balkarov 1964, 99) are unacceptable. Abdokov compares the WC form with PEC \I*nħĕƛ̣V\i 'milk' (q.v.), which seems less  plausible than the comparison with \I*rħăƛwV\i because of the unexplained loss of  glottalisation in PWC.
1447|*š̲ä̆mʔV ( ~ -ʡ-)|930|milk; udder|*šim|555|*š:imHu|862||0||0||0||0||0|*čˊǝ|438|    The affricatisation (šˊ > čˊ) in PWC can be probably explained if we assume a dental prefix (\Ičˊǝ\i < \I*T-šˊǝ,\i possibly of a class origin); dental prefixation is less frequent in PWC than labial prefixation, but several cases of it are attested.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 277 (at least the comparison of Ub. \Ičˊa\i and And. \Iš:iwu\i is correct).

The Khin. form obviously belongs here, although the metathesis \Ieng\i (instead of \I*neg\i) is not quite clear; other languages do not allow to reconstruct any root structure except *RVCV. All other forms are completely regular.     Abayev (1958, 544) suggests some Caucasian source (connected with Khin. \Ieng\i) for Osset. \Iingˊɨn\i 'curds'.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241.
1450|*ʔVlVdwV ( ~ -r-)|0|beer; whey||0|*rVdV|864|*ʔɔlɔdu ( ~ -r-)|659||0||0||0||0||0|    The semantic correlation "beer, alcoholic beverage" : "whey, sour milk product" is rather frequent (because some alcoholic drinks were made out of milk or whey).     This Avar-Tsez isogloss is rather interesting, because it is certainly an old Iranian (Scythian) loanword, ultimately going back to a Germanic source (Proto-Germanic \I*aluδ\i 'beer' < PIE \I*alut-\i). The root is still present in Osset. \Iälūton,\i and was also borrowed (probably from an early Ossetian source) into Georg. \Iludi\i (dial. \Ialudi\i) 'beer' - see Abayev 1,130-131. Regardless of whether this loanword penetrated East Caucasian languages during the period of the Avaro-Ando-Tsezian unity or somewhat later, it must have been borrowed before the change *l > r occurred in Avaro-Andian (unfortunately, Tsez. -r- here is uninformative: it can go back to both PTs *-r- and -l-).

The root is rather widely attested and has several nominal derivates in several subgroups; one of them, \I*ʒ̲urV-lV\i 'filter, sieve' (PL \I*c̣:urVl(a\i), PD \I*zurla\i > \I*zula,\i Av. \Ic̣:uraˊ\i) can be also reconstructed for PEC.

One of the roots with the structure *HRVHV. The original meaning is probably 'moisture, liquid; to become wet, soak' (this root can be both nominal and verbal), with subsequent development > a) 'stream, pool; wet'; b) 'whey, ferment'.

Except for the not quite clear laryngeal (in the cluster *-rH-), correspondences are regular.    Cf. Osset. \Isīr\i / \Iserä\i 'meal made of flour and buttermilk' (see Abayev 1979, 112), most probably of Caucasian origin (there is no reason to postulate the reverse direction of borrowing, as Abayev does). Also interesting is Lat. \Iserum\i 'whey, buttermilk'
1454|*ʔĕc̣wĂ|0|raw, sour; to get sour|*ṭune|560||0|*ʔɔc̣|662||0||0|*ʔäc̣ʷV|940||0|*Pc̣V|439|    The PN form (as well as PAK \I*c̣ǝ-na\i) contains a suffixed *-nV (originally participial); the weak initial syllable with a laryngeal is reduced (which probably reflects the Ablaut grade \I*ʔĭc̣wĂ\i). The WC form contains a labial (class) prefix, with a usual in this case delabialisation of the affricate. The comparison of PAK \I*c̣ǝ-na\i with Lezg. was proposed by Rogava (1956, 81); see also Абдоков 1983, 150-151.

The PN and PL forms correspond well to each other; the Gin. and Khin. forms, however, raise some doubts (the Gin. form has irregular vocalism and final -n; in Khin. one would rather expect a form like \I*č̣im\i).

For PEC we can also reconstruct a reduplicated stem \I*twVtwVr-\i (cf. PA \I*-itit-\i = Lak. \Ita-ta-\i), also witnessed in a nominal derivate \I*twVrtwV(-lV)\i > Lak. \Itartala,\i PC \I*tǝtu.\i

The meaning 'cream, sour cream' in Lak. and Darg. is a natural development < *'top' ("top of milk"); it may, however, also have been favoured by the influence of the verbal root \I*=itwVr\i 'to curdle' (q.v.) (cf. Lak. \Itata-n,\i PD \I*=ert-\i / \I*rut-\i).     If the original meaning of the root was closer to Lezghian (i.e. "wheel set on the spindle top", whence simply "top"), it would be possible to think of an Iranian (Indo-Iranian) source like \I*varta-\i or \I*vr̲tti-\i 'spinning, spinning object'.

Some irregularities (loss of glottalisation in Av., Bezht., Darg., weakening *č:- > č- in Avar, assimilation *č- > č̣- in PL) are probably due to the root's structure (these are processes frequently occurring in roots containing two stops); some of them, however, can be explained by interlingual borrowing. Above we have listed reflexes that are most likely to be genuine. Besides them, there are more or less obvious loanwords: Lak. \Ičut:u\i 'cake', Chech. \Ičutta\i 'stuffed boiled cake', Av. \Ičuduˊ\i id., Lezg. \Iküt\i ( < \I*čʷit\i) 'a k. of bread'. Judging from the phonetic side, all of these words have ultimately a Dargwa source (PD \I*čut:ʷi,\i see above).

In several languages the root was influenced by the similar PEC \I*gīrgwV\i 'round' q.v.; the Andian reflexes, however, show that this is quite a different root.

The PN form goes back to \I*kurʒɨ̆,\i the PL - to \I*gurcɨ̆;\i Darg. reflects an assimilated form \I*gurʒɨ̆.\i Phenomena like this are typical for roots containing two stops, so they do not throw doubt on the etymology.

The medial resonant must be reconstructed because of the PTs reflex *-χ:- (otherwise *-χ- or *-ʁ:- would be expected); other languages do not contradict it.

The verb is preserved only in WC and in the Eastern Daghestan area (PL, Khin.); Av., Lak., Darg. and PTs have preserved only the reflexes of the nominal derivate \I*qwVrHV\i 'something woven' (probably < \I*wiqVrHV\i). The same derivate (with metathesis) is reflected in PL \I*ruχ(a\i).
1479|*q̲̇[ĕ]rV|0|felt cloak or boots||0|*q̇:oru ( ~ -a-)|894|*q̇ir|679||0|*q̇Iar(V)|524|*q̇VrV-j|967||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. Despite some problems with the vocalism (it was certainly a front vowel - cf. also the Darg. pharyngealization, which is an additional proof of it - but its precise quality is hard to guess), the reconstruction seems secure enough. The semantic variation ('top of boot' vs. 'cloak') is explained by the fact that these two objects were preferably made of felt.

Except for occasional assimilations (usual in a root with two stops), correspondences are regular. Cf. also HU: Hurr. \Ikarkar-ni,\i Ur. \Iqarqara-\i 'armour' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 58). It is interesting to note the recurring meaning 'coat of mail, armour' (in Nakh, HU, Lezg.): it shows that the root may have designated some piece of armour or warrior's garment in PEC.
1481|*xaɫV|0|mitten||0|*kʷo-λala ( ~ o)|897||0||0||0|*λ[u]λal|971||0||0|    An interesting And-Lezg. isogloss (reflecting the old compound \I*kwīlʔɨ-xaɫV\i).

The quality of the medial resonant is not quite clear; otherwise correspondences are regular.

Except for assimilative glottalisation in  some languages (which is a usual phenomenon), correspondences are regular. The  root must have specifically meant 'hook, hook for fastening > clasp, buckle'  (which explains the frequent semantic shift > 'button'). An apparent EC loan is Georg. kič̣o 'meat-hook (of a butcher).

It is interesting to note that Archi, besides the verb \I=ubƛa-s\i which is a regular parallel for the Av.-And.-Tsez. forms, has also a noun: \Iimƛ̣:ǝla\i '(knitted) sock, stocking'. This must be an old loanword from some Andian source: cf. Cham. \Iini-biƛ̣:inna-b\i 'sock, stocking' (lit. "(smth.) put inside") and Akhv. \Iiƛ̣:el\i 'stocking' - derivates from the same PA root \I*=iƛ̣:Vn-.\i

See Shagirov 1, 218-219 and Knobloch 1958, 198 (about the Adygh form as the probable source of European: Gr. \Isykkhos,\i Lat. \Isoccus\i etc.).

One can not exclude a possibility of PN borrowing from PA or vice versa - thus it can be, in fact, a Nakh-Lezg. or Aand-Lezg. isogloss.     The root is probably connected with the 'wandering' word: Osset. \Imes\i / \Imestäl\i, Turk. (Anat.) \Imest\i, Georg. \Imesṭi\i etc. (see Abayev 1973, 112).

A complicated case, because of active segmental phonetic interaction. In Proto-Av.-And. we must suppose an early dissimilatory deglottalisation -ƛ̣- > -ƛ-. The PL form is a metathesis: \I*q:Iurt:iƛ̣:an\i < \I*q:Iurƛ̣Vn-t:V,\i probably reflecting an original suffixed (plural?) form exactly corresponding to Av. \Iq̇:andaˊλo\i < \I*q̇:VƛVn-dV.\i The final part *-cV in the PTs form is unclear (is it also a development of *-dV in the cluster *-ƛd- > *-ƛc-??). Despite these difficulties, the EC etymology seems to us rather probable.

The Lak. form probably was borrowed in Avar: Av. \Ic̣:aχaˊ\i (not genuinely related because of the irregular c̣:-), which, in its turn, was borrowed by Archi (\Ic̣aχa\i id.). It is, however, not clear whether we should relate here also the phonetically aberrant Darg. forms: Ak. \Icarka\i 'floor-cloth'; Ak., Ur. \Ič̣uqan\i 'floor-mat'.     The word has possible parallels in Iranian: Osset. \Isarɣ,\i Afg. \Isarɣ,\i Sogd. \Is'ɣr\i 'saddle' ( > Arab. \Isarǯ\i > Pers. \Isarǯ\i), Pam. \Isirekh,\i \Isiregh\i 'woollen blanket, mattress', see Abayev 1979, 34-35.

The PTs vocalism reflects nasalisation (otherwise PTs would have *-ɨ-), so it probably goes back to \I*kɨṭV-n\i or \I*ḳɨṭV-m\i (cf. the Avar parallel).

Some other languages reveal similar but irregular forms: cf. Av. \Iʁud,\i Arch. \IχIit\i 'spoon' - perhaps, old interlingual loanwords.     In PL we would rather expect \I*q:uṭ,\i not \I*q:ʷɨṭ\i (reconstructed on basis of Kryz. \Iq:ʷaṭ-ɨǯ\i). It is, in fact, possible that the Kryz. form reflexes a merger with another root, reflected mainly in the Av.-And. area: cf. Av. \Iʕortoˊ\i 'a cylinder-shaped vessel' (whence probably Lak. \IuIrtu\i 'clay vessel'), PA \I*q̇ʷVrtV\i / \I*ʁʷVrtV\i > Akhv. \Iq̇oto\i (Tlan. \Iq̇ortu,\i Ratl. \Iq̇orto,\i Tseg. \Iorto\i) 'a measuring vessel', Tind. \Iʁʷarta\i 'mortar'. In that case a reconstruction \I*q:uṭ\i is also possible for PL.

It must have denoted a big wooden vessel (hence the meaning 'boat' in PWC), with a secondary development > 'earthenware vessel' (PN, PA). The meaning 'sack, bag' in PL is obviously secondary, possibly under Turkic influence - nevertheless, PL \I*χ(:)ʷap:\i can not be regarded as a loan from Turkic \I*kap\i (the initial fricative χ- can not render Turk. k-).

Not quite clear is Tsez. \Iḳoši\i 'wooden spoon': perhaps it can be regarded as a modification of the same root under the influence of \Iḳowzi\i 'spoon' ( < Georg.), or else as a back-loan from Osset. (cf. Osset. \Iḳūs\i / \Iḳos\i 'scoop, dipper'; on its Caucasian origin see Abayev 1958, 642).

Not very reliable, because of the strange behaviour of the stem in Lezghian languages; besides, labialised -ʒw- should not have yielded -ṭṭ- in a cluster in PN.

It is not quite clear whether we should also relate here Lak. Bartkh. (cited in Хайдаков 1966) \Imarza\i 'some detail of a plough'; voiced -z- is  quite irregular, and the word could be an old loanword from some related source  (cf. the Nakh form \I*mārs\i or the voicing in PTs \I*bǝzɔ\i).

The word has different suffixes in all three subgroups (*-ɫV in PA, *-rV in Lak., *-mV in PL - the latter possibly due to reduplication).

Cf. also Hurr. \Iošχo(-ne)\i / \Iušχu(-ne)\i 'silver' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 46-47), where -šχ- regularly goes back to the cluster *-rc-. The early PHU form \I*Hwercχ-\i (reflecting an intermediate stage in the process *-rc- > *-rcχ- > *-cχ-) was borrowed in Proto-Kartvelian as \I*werc̥1̇χl-\i (the comparison of PK, PWC and PEC forms was first suggested in Charaya 1912, 11). A similar form exists also in Semitic (Proto-Semitic \I*ḥrṣ\i); it is therefore impossible to suggest a simple loan from Indo-European \I*rgˊnto-\i in Caucasian languages - to say nothing of enormous phonetic problems arising with this supposition. Although some Caucasian forms may have experienced Indo-European (Indo-Iranian) influence (see above in the WC section), it seems rather more probable that PIE had borrowed this archaic Near Eastern root, which on Indo-European ground had contaminated with the pure Indo-European root \I*Har(ǝ)gˊ-\i 'light, white'.  The root reveals a "floating" labialisation: some forms are best explained by a protoform \I*ɦĕrVcwĭ\i (PL, with spirantization of *-c-, PWC), some - by \I*ɦwĕrVcĭ\i (Av.-And., PD, HU). It is interesting to note the Ossetian name of 'silver': \Iävzīst\i / \Iävzestä\i (having penetrated into Fenno-Ugric: Udm. \Iazvesˊ,\i Komi \Iezysˊ,\i Hung. \Iezüst,\i see Abayev 1958, 213). The Indo-European etymology of this word (see ibid.), belonging to Petersson, is very dubious, and it can also have a NC source (reflecting the original labialisation).         Finally it is interesting to note the similarity of this root and PNC \I*rĕwcwĭ\i 'gold, red copper' (q.v.): perhaps it is possible to think of an archaic word-derivation with a laryngeal prefix.

Correspondences are regular (except that we would rather expect \I*muχ\i or \I*maχ\i in PD - thus it is not excluded that the PD form, as well as Lak. \Imeχ:,\i is also a loanword). Since the root is often used for denoting objects made of iron (beads, horseshoe, hoe/mattock etc.), it seems tempting to compare Ub. \Imaχʷǝˊta\i 'hoe'. Phonetically the comparison seems satisfactory (presupposing PNC \I*mɦŏχU\i), but the Ub. word does not have cognates in other WC languages, and its morphological structure is not quite clear, so the problem needs further investigation.

Alternative comparison, proposed by Rogava 1956,6 (with Av. \Imesed\i 'gold' etc., Georg. \Ibeč̣edi\i 'ring'), is unacceptable for phonetic reasons.

It is interesting to note the Ossetian word for 'brass': Osset. \Iärxʷǝ\i / \Iärxi,\i as well as its Fenno-Ugric names: Komi \Iyrgön,\i Udm. \Iyrgon,\i Mar. \Ivörgene,\i Mans. \Iärgin\i (comparison of the Osset. and Fenno-Ugric forms see in Abayev 1958, 186; he does not, however, mention Caucasian forms).

Otherwise correspondences are regular, and the etymology seems quite satisfactory. See Abdokov 1983, 102 (Av.-And. : WC; the author also cites,  however, a non-existant Darg. \Iṭabs\i 'copper' and Lak. \Iṭi\i 'bronze' which can not  belong here).

The root is not very widely spread, but phonetically and semantically the comparison seems satisfactory. A strange form is Darg. Chir. \Iɣanta\i 'charcoal': it can not go back to PD *k:a (k:- would be expected in Chir.), and it does not correspond regularly to Tsakh. \Iɣadɨr\i (thus a separate root can not be postulated): perhaps it is a loanword from some Lezgian language (e.g., the Lezg. counterpart of Tsakh. \Iɣadɨr\i would be \I*ɣat:V(r\i)).

Many languages reflect the PEC derivate \I*w-Hiḳ̲wVnV\i 'tool for spinning / knitting' (needle or thread). We must also mention that in some languages this derivate merged with PEC \I*w-ilq̲̇wVnV\i 'tool for sewing' ( < \I*=ilq̲̇wVn\i 'sew' q.v.).

Reasons for the -n-conjugation in Av.-And. are not clear (as in a number of other cases); other languages do not have any traces of nasalisation. The root must originally have been prefixless: cf. the Av. form, and the identity of derivates PL \I*ʔi(r)χʷVra\i = PN \I*ʔurχal\i ( < PEC \I*ʔirχʷVrV\i / \I*ʔirχʷVlV\i). Therefore class prefixation in most modern languages (as well as prefixation in PD derivates \I*b-irχVla\i / \I*b-arχVrV\i and \I*d-irχVla\i) should be regarded as secondary.     The Khin. form \Imiχez\i is interesting: it may reflect an archaic derivative pattern with the instrumental prefix *m- (< \I*m-irχʷVrV\i 'the instrument of sewing'); no other explanation of m- seems to be available in this case.

The shape of the word in PA (\I*ri-kun\i) suggests that it could have been a deverbal noun (although the original verb stem is not attested anywhere). If this is so, we could perhaps reconstruct a verbal root \I*=VkwV\i "to sew" and relate here also PEC \I*kwĕlʕV\i 'thread' q.v. (another deverbal noun - perhaps < \I*-Vkwel(H)V\i); cf. also the non-etymologized Ud. \IbeIk\i 'needle'. One needs, however, more data to draw final conclusions. [Cf., perhaps, Rut. \Iṭ-u=ka-\i 'to knit' with an expressive preverb?]

This is one of the common NC roots demonstrating the correspondence EC *Ł (in tense words) : WC *ɣ. Correspondences are regular, except for the secondary loss of labialisation in PWC.

We should note, however, that PTs \I*ʕɔ˜ƛ̣\i means both 'spindle' and 'handle', the latter certainly going back to PEC \I*ʕülƛ̣̲wɨ̆\i 'handle' (q.v.). If we assume that the Agul form also goes back to \I*ʕülƛ̣̲wɨ̆\i (with an irregular development of *ƛ̣w in a tense word - -k:- would be regularly expected), the reconstruction \I*ʕănƛ̣V\i should be abandoned.

Except for some resonant interaction (PD \I*=imχ:Vr\i < \I*=irχ:ʷVn,\i variation in PL) correspondences are regular, and the reconstruction seems reliable.

Not quite clear is the origin of PTs nasalisation (just as in another case, PEC \I*ʔiǯwVr\i 'lick' > PTs \I*=a˜č-\i). Andian languages reflect only a deverbal noun (with a frequent circumfix *b- -n).

The PWC form goes back rather to a form like \I*kɨ̄rṭwā\i (with shift of labialisation).     The only strange phenomenon is the uvular pharyngealized q̇I- in Lak. (and a similar form in Rut.); reasons for such a development are unclear, but it is hard to keep the Lak. and Rut. forms away from the rest.

The PK form is \I*soḳo-,\i see Klimov 1964, 165 (with a variant \Izoḳo-\i in Georgian: the voiced z- shows that the original source of at least this variant in Kartvelian could have been Tsezian). From Georgian the word was borrowed into some Caucasian languages: back into some Tsezian (e.g., Gunz. \Izoḳo;\i see above), Bacb. \Izoḳŏ,\i Osset. \Izoḳo.\i Despite Klimov (ibid.), however, Arm. \Isunk:\i can not be explained as a loan from Kartvelian, but has rather an Indo-European etymology (see below).     In Indo-European we have \I*spongo-\i (see WP 2, 681-682) 'sponge, mushroom, tinder'; some authors (see ibid.) even try to reconstruct a complicated protoform \I*sphwongo-\i (to explain, beside Greek \Ispoˊngo-s,\i Arm. \Isunk:\i also forms like Germ. \I*swamba-\i and Slav. \I*go˜ba\i).

To judge from the variety of meanings in modern languages, the original meaning was something like "rock near a precipice" or "a hollow in the mountain slope".

Similar forms are observed in other Caucasian and geographically close languages: cf. Kartv. \I*kwrdeml-\i 'anvil', Az. \Igˊirdin\i 'log'. Klimov (1972, 352) must be right in supposing a Kartvelian source for some EC forms like Bacb. \Igrdem\i 'anvil', Lezg. \Igirdim\i 'log, block' (Klimov also lists Tsakh. \Igˊirdǝm\i 'log', Tab. \Igerdem,\i Ud. \Igürdüm\i 'big stone, boulder' - forms which we were unable to check; we can add to the list Bezht. \Igerden\i 'big stone; log', Khosh. \Igerem\i 'log', Inkh. \Igeren\i 'hammer', finally, Av. \Igeren\i 'small log, block'). However, the ultimate source of the Kartvelian forms is probably PNC \I*kŏrdV\i (with a productive suffix \I*kŏrdV-mV\i).

(Note that PTs \I*=ɔʁ:-\i may represent a contamination of this root and PNC \I*=Hĕlχ̲U\i q.v., which would explain the meanings 'take away, take off' in Tsezian languages). Cf. also HU: Hurr., Urart. \Iχa-\i 'to take (away, etc.)', see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 61.     Other possible derivates from the same root are PNC \I*mŏχ̲V\i 'pack, bundle' q.v.

The PWC form has a frequent labial prefix, after which there occurred (as in very many cases) a dissimilatory delabialisation.

The root is very close phonetically to \I*ʡwĭlʡĭ\i 'eye', and in Lak. and Avar the two words are indeed homonymous. However, reflexes differ in PD and Bezht., thus the homonymy is most probably accidental.     It is interesting to note an analogous homonymy in Georgian (\Itwali\i means both "eye" and "wheel") - this could be due to an influence of EC languages, where the two words coincided by chance.

The original meaning 'dark, blue' in several subgroups developped to 'blue metal' > 'iron' (on the possible explanation of this semantic change see above, in the WC section). The PN form meaning 'iron' (\I*ɦāχḳi\i) can be explained best of all if we suppose a laryngeal prefix : \I*nHǟƛ̣̲wV̆\i 'blue' - \I*h-nǟƛ̣̲ū\i (or \I*h-ǟnƛ̣̲wV̆\i) 'blue thing, metal' (cf. the same archaic derivational model in the pair \I*mĭʒ̲V\i 'sweet' - \I*H-mĭʒ̲ū\i 'sweet thing, honey'). In that case we can also relate here (from the derived noun) a local EC root meaning 'horseshoe' (the semantic development is natural: cf. numerous cases like Darg. \Imeχ\i 'iron; horseshoe' etc.):     PTs \I*heƛ(u\i) A: Tsez., Gin. \Ihiƛu\i (PTsKh \I*heƛu\i); Gunz., Bezht. \Iheƛ\i (PGB \I*heƛ\i); PL \I*Häƛ̣:(a\i), reconstructed on basis of a relic form: Rut. \Iäg\i 'horseshoe'.     Finally, another derivate from the same root may be PEC \I*nɦäƛ̣̲wV\i 'gadfly, horsefly' (possibly as a "blue insect") q.v.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241 (Lak.-Arch.).

The PTs form is a compound of \I*ƛ̣ɔn-\i ( < \I*ƛ̣Vl-\i 'saddle', see \I*ƛ̣̲wiɫē\i) with \I*q̇ʷelV\i 'saddle-girth'. It is possible that the Kryz. word \Iq̇iq̇er\i reflects the same compound, with a subsequent distortion (\Iq̇iq̇er\i < \I*ƛ̣:(ʷ)il-q̇(ʷ)al\i).     In Archi, besides the obvious Avar loanword \Iq̇ʷal\i 'saddle-girth' there exists also a form \Iq̇ʷalur\i (plur. tant. in -ur) 'swaddling-bands' which may be genuinely related to the listed forms.

A very complicated case. It is probable that the word is a PEC compound, and it is possible to decipher PEC \I*jĕrƛ̣̲wV\i 'belt, leather strap' in its second part. The first part, in that case, can be reconstructed approximately as \I*čɦVm(V\i)-, but it is difficult to identify this morpheme with any independent EC root. The original polyconsonantal structure \I*čɦVm-jĕrƛ̣̲wV,\i having an expressive meaning ("whip"), naturally underwent very complicated and irregular changes in most daughter-languages.

The Lak. and Av. word are probably borrowed (cf. the secondary devoicing of k-, resembling the devoicing in the PL form: it is, however, hardly possible to deduce PL \I*kʷitan\i from Lak. or Av., thus the loan was probably reverse).     The PNC reconstruction given here is highly tentative, primarily, because of the irregular correspondence between EC and WC. The word is also present in other languages of the Caucasus: Georg. \Igutani,\i Osset. \Igūton\i / \Igoton,\i Arm. \Igutan,\i Azerb. \Ikotan,\i but does not have a secure etymology in any of these languages.

As with many cultural terms, correspondences are not quite regular: the medial resonant has to be postulated (to account for the development * q̲ > q: in PL; otherwise *q would be expected); however, in the case of medial *-n- we would rather expect a change \I*monq\i > \I*noq\i in PN. One can not exclude a possibility of ancient interlingual loans, which have led to distortion of regular sound laws in this case.

We should stress that Lak. \Iruḳ\i and PD \I*duḳ\i 'yoke', however similar, still belong to another root (see \I*riḳwV\i) (although of course the root \I*ʔrĕg̲wĔ\i could have influenced it). In PWC the root obtained a prefixed labial (a rather frequent development), with a usual in such cases delabialisation of the following consonant. See Trubetzkoy 1922,  241, Abdokov 1983, 131.     We will probably be right in separating the root \I*ʔrĕg̲wĔ\i from a slightly similar cultural Wanderwort, present in many linguistic families of the Near East: IE \I*i̲eug-\i / \I*i̲ug-,\i PK \I*uʁel-,\i Sem. \I*ʁull-,\i the source of which may be ultimately Indo-European (cf. IE \I*i̲eug-\i 'to bind'). See abundant discussion of this root in Illich-Svitych 1965, 334-335, Goniashvili 1940, 581, Klimov 1964, 186, Deeters 1957, 390. There are traces of this root in NC languages as well: cf. Abkh. \Ia-wǝˊʁʷ,\i Ub. \Iʁawǝˊ\i (possibly borrowed from Kartvelian, see Charaya 1912, 15; Illich-Svitych ibid.; Shagirov 1,90; however, a reconstruction like PWC \I*wVGwV\i is also possible, and the precise direction of loan is still to be determined), Tab. (Kand.) \Iuʁin\i 'yoke for one ox' (as opposed to \Ijirk:aʁ\i "yoke for two oxen"). As we see, they are very sparse, and probably represent a later loanword - at any rate, having nothing to do with PNC \I*ʔrĕg̲wĔ.\i

The Andian form shows that in Lak. and Darg. a merger of two roots (PEC \I*rɨḳwV\i and PEC \I*ʔrĕg̲wĔ\i q.v.) had taken place (the latter root, originally meaning "yoke", should be normally reflected in Lak. as \I*t:Vrk:ʷ-\i or \I*dVk:ʷ-,\i and in PD - as \I*dVrk:ʷ-\i).

It is probably wiser to think of a secondary contamination of the two roots in some languages (Av.-And. and Darg.).

Av.-And.-Tsezian languages reflect a metathesized variant \I*nVcˊV.\i     A suffixed form of the same root can be reconstructed for PNC as \I*cˊVnV-ḳwV\i 'a k. of sickle, scythe'. It is reflected in PEC as \I*č̣inVḳwV\i (with assimilation), and in PWC as \I*čʷVmVgV.\i Cf. for PEC: Av. Chad. \Ič̣iniˊḳ,\i And. (Khaidakov) \Ič̣iniḳ,\i Bezht. Tlad. \Ič̣iniḳ,\i Khosh. \Ic̣iniḳ,\i Gunz. \Ič̣iniḳ\i (PTs \I*č̣iniḳ\i), Lak. \Ič̣iniḳ,\i Darg. Chir. \Ič̣inaḳ\i 'scythe', PL \I*č̣inaḳʷ\i (Ag. \Ič̣ineḳʷ,\i Lezg. Khl. \Ič̣anag\i 'sickle', Rut. \Ič̣inaḳʷ,\i Tsakh. \Ič̣inaḳ,\i Arch. \Ič̣iniḳʷ\i 'scythe'). Some of these forms may be borrowed from neighbour languages, but at least the PL form and either Av. or Lak. are probably genuine and go back to PEC. For PWC cf.: PAT \I*čǝbǝgV\i (Abkh. \Ia-čbǝˊga,\i Abaz. \Ičbǝg\i), PAK \I*čˊamaˊgˊǝ\i (Ad. \Išˊamaǯˊ,\i Kab. \Išamaǯ\i), Ub. \Ičˊamaˊgˊ.\i The Ub. form is probably borrowed from Ad., but the PAT and PAK forms are genuine cognates.     Osset. \Icäväg\i 'scythe' is explained by Abayev (1, 306) as a derivate from \Icävyn\i 'to beat' (which itself is etymologically obscure, see ibid.); therefore he regards the WC forms as borrowed from Ossetian, and this hypothesis is accepted by Shagirov 2, 137. However, the Ossetian source can not explain many phonetic features of its Caucasian counterparts (in particular, nasalisation present in most NC forms). It seems to us much more reasonable to suppose that the Ossetian form itself was borrowed from a Caucasian source (cf., e.g., PAT \I*čǝbǝgV\i with secondary denasalisation). Later it was, in its turn, borrowed in some EC languages: cf. Cham. \Ičag\i (Gig. \Ičagi\i), God. \Ičogi\i 'scythe' - forms that are absolutely irregular compared to other EC forms, and can be easily derived from a source like Proto-Ossetian \I*čavag.\i See Starostin 1985, 81.

Not quite secure is the reconstruction of labialisation in PNC: in PWC we would rather expect a usual dissimilatory delabialisation after a labial. Since the attested Av.-And.-Tsezian forms can go back both to *-cˊw- and to *-cˊ-, we would prefer to reconstruct a non-labialized *-cˊ- and assume an assimilatory process in PWC.

The alternative comparison (Balkarov 1964, 99) of the WC forms with Av. \Iq:ʷ-,\i PA \I*χ:an-\i (note that Av. and PA are actually different roots) 'to mow' is untenable for phonetic reasons (the PWC velar can not correspond to a PEC uvular).

Labialisation in Andian is irregular (one would rather expect a form like \I*χilV\i). There are two possible explanations: either we should rather reconstruct PEC \I*χ̲ǟwɫV\i with a cluster (yielding labialisation in And. and simplified in PN and PL), or we should assume that And. \Iχʷolo\i (isolated among Andian languages) is a loanword from Nakh (with labialisation rendering the Nakh narrow -ō- = /-wō-/).     We can also pay attention to Lak. \Iχ:ala-\i in \Iχ:ala-baḳu\i 'haystack' which can also correspond to the PN and PL forms - although synchronically Lak. \Iχ:ala-\i is the oblique base of \Iχ:ulū\i 'hay', which has a different EC origin (see \I*χǖɫV\i). Both roots must have merged in Lak. for phonetic reasons.

Very well represented, however, are two common EC derivates: \I*r-ĕŁō\i 'threshing, grain ready for threshing' and \I*m-ɨ̄(r)ŁV\i 'threshing board'. PA \I*bilimV\i (corresponding to the latter form) is probably a metathesis < \I*mili-bV\i (with *-bV as a former plural affix). If our analysis is right, we have here another case of the PEC instrumental prefix *m-.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 242.

Both semantically and phonetically the etymology seems quite plausible. Attempts to compare the Adygh forms with different Caucasian material (Osset. \Imäḳʷǝl\i / \Ibäḳʷäl\i 'stack', Georg. \Imagoli\i etc. - see Abayev 2, 85, or with Arch. \Imaḳʷ\i 'thistle' - see Shagirov 1, 265) - seem in every respect less acceptable.     Abdokov (1983, 110-111) compares the EC forms with \I*-qʷa\i in PAK  \I*xʷǝ(r)-qʷa\i 'chaff' (with \I*xʷǝ-\i 'millet' in the first part), whence Ad.  (Bzhed.) \Ifǝr-q:ʷa,\i Kab. \Ixʷǝ-qʷa.\i Although the semantic match is exact, the  phonetic side raises some questions (tense *q:ʷ would be expected in PAK). It  is possible that \I*maq:ʷǝ\i 'hay' and \I*-qʷa\i 'chaff' actually represent a single  root, with a secondary distortion within a compound with PAK \I*xʷǝ-\i 'millet'.

The EC-WC comparison seems quite  probable (with a secondary dissimilative development *šʷ- > *š- in WC), if the  PAK form really goes back to a PWC form with hushing *š- (unfortunately, there  are no AA and Ub. data, which would verify it).     See Abdokov 1983, 102 (Tsez. \Išem:\i WC; Av. \Iʕansiˊ\i 'snow-drift', also cited  by the author, belongs to quite a different root).

The PN reflex *sṭ- is explained by the influence of *-j- (preserved in the WC form).     In some languages there is confusion between this root and the diminutive form of the PNC word for star, \I*ʒ̲hwăr-ḳV\i (\I/*ʒ̲hwăr-kV\i). The latter is certainly reflected in Ub. \Ic̣ʷa(n)-ḳ\iˊ and Lak. \Ic̣uku\i (cf. plur. \Ic̣ur-t:i\i). The Cham.

The reconstruction of *ǯ is based on the correspondence Ub. ʒ : PAT *ʒˊ. It is not excluded, however, that the original PAT form \I*(a)ʒV\i underwent an influence of other roots: PAT \I*sˊǝ\i 'snow' and PAT \I*ʒˊǝ-nǝ\i 'winter', and changed into \I*(a)ʒˊV\i by analogy. In that case PWC \I*ʒǝ\i could be reconstructed (in Ub. both *ǯ and *ʒ yield ʒ), which would be a perfect match for PEC \I*jămʒĂ.\i     Abdokov (1983, 99-100) compares the EC forms with PAK \I*č:apǝ\i 'hoar-frost',  which seems much less probable (for phonetic reasons).

We should notice that this is the only case where PN preserves *s after *j- (without changing it to *st); since *j- is reconstructed here only on Nakh evidence, one may think that PN *j- is secondary here, and a reconstruction like \I*Hansē\i could be preferable. One should also keep in mind that in some languages there is occasional confusion of the roots \I*jansē\i and \I*jămʒĂ\i q.v. (which led Balkarov - 1964, 98 - to proposing wrong EC connections for the WC form \I*sˊǝ\i), but in general the two roots are being kept quite distinct from each other. The comparison of WC \I*sˊǝ\i with PK \I*(s̥1̇)to-\i 'to snow' (Rogava 1955, 36) seems much less probable. See Abdokov 1983, 105.     Note the frequent recurrence of the (oblique base) suffix *-rV (in PN, several Andian languages and Bezht. \Iazo-ra\i).

Dissimilatory delabialisation after an initial labial is normal in PWC, as well as the palatalized reflex *Lˊ (since non-palatalized *L is not reconstructed). A minor phonetic problem is, however, the preservation of nasal *m- in PWC (a non-nasal *P- would be expected before the following -r-resonant). It is not excluded, however, that *-r- in the PL form \I*merƛ̣:ʷ\i is secondary (duplicating the -r- of the oblique stem \I*meƛ̣:ʷV-rV-\i > \I*merƛ̣:ʷV-rV-,\i cf. modern obl. stems like Ag. \Imerk:ur-a-,\i Bursh. \Imirk:-ri-,\i Rut. \Imɨkɨrɨ-,\i Kryz. \Imɨkɨr-\i). In that case \I*mäƛ̣̲wɨ̆\i should be reconstructed for PEC, and the PWC correspondence would be wholly regular.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241, 243; 1930, 276; Abdokov 1983, 97.

See Dumeˊzil 1933, 15.     An interesting form is Georg. \Iadli\i 'cubit' - it may reflect a loan from early PWC (*a-Łˊǝ); Georg. > Osset. \Iadli\i / \Iadili\i (see Abayev 1958, 30).

Outside the Andian area, however, most languages had lost the root \I*HrVŁ̲V̆\i and \I*č̣ʷimħV\i obtained first the meaning 'span (in general)', and sometimes (after the penetration of new words - for the most part borrowed, like Turk. \Ičejrek\i < Pers. \Ičahār-yak\i - with the meaning 'span between the thumb and the small finger') - the meaning 'span between the thumb and the fore-finger'.     The comparison of PEC \I*č̣wimħV\i and PWC \I*ǯa\i is tempting, although it presents some phonetic problems. Labialisation in PEC can be secondary (due to assimilation < \I*č̣imħV\i); loss of the cluster *-mħ- in PWC is also regular. However, lack of palatalisation in PWC can not be explained - we would regularly expect a form like \I*č̣ˊa\i or \I*ǯˊa.\i Perhaps this is a case of a very archaic Ablaut, involving alternation of a front and a back vowel.

If this parallel is correct, then Darg. \Iluʕi\i and Inkh. \Iloje\i must be regarded as an archaism, lost in most modern EC languages.

This is the main reason for reconstructing *j- in PEC and PNC, and other languages do not contradict it (the final proof would of course be the Nakh and Lezghian data: in fact, it seems possible that in some Lezghian languages there occurred a confusion of PL roots \I*jo(r)q:\i 'time' and \I*jiq:\i 'day' < PEC \I*Hwiq̲̇V\i q.v.; thus, Lezg. lit. \Ijuʁ\i 'day' has an unexplained -u- which would very well fit for a reflex of PL \I*jo(r)q:\i).     Trubetzkoy (1930) compared the WC forms with Lak. \Iʁi\i 'summer' ( < \I*ʁwĭnʔV\i) q.v. and with some reflexes of PEC \I*G̲HōlnV\i 'summer'. This etymology (confusing two different EC roots) did not take into account the existence of an opposition between \I*ʁˊa\i and \I*ʁˊIʷa\i in PWC, and should be now abolished. See  also a discussion of the two roots in Abdokov 1983, 94-95 (also with a great  deal of confusion between several EC and WC roots, although the comparison  of PA \I*q̇:oru\i and Ub. \Iʁˊa\i is correct). Absolutely improbable is the comparison of WC forms with Georg. \Idro\i 'time' and \Idʁe\i 'day' (Lomtatidze 1955) or with  Av. \Iriʔi\i 'summer' (Shagirov 1).

In PL (Tsakh.) the root underwent metathesis: \I*nɨwca\i > \I*muca\i > \I*cuma.\i With analogous metathesis we can possibly relate here also Darg. \Iucm-ij\i 'ruler, prince'.

Although superficially the Darg. and Lezg. forms look quite alike, the correspondence between them is irregular. There are two possible explanations:     a) the original form was \I*-ilq̲wV\i (which should have yielded PD \I*-ilq:ʷ-\i or \I*-ulq:-,\i and PA \I*-i(r\i)q:ʷ-), but in PD and PA there occurred a contamination with PEC \I*-iqʷV\i 'to run' - q.v. This hypothesis is possible, but not very likely, because we have to suppose an independent contamination in two branches (PA and PD);     b) the original form was \I*-ilqwV,\i which regularly yielded PA \I*-iqʷ-\i and PD \I*-ulq-;\i in PL we should expect \I*ʔilχʷe-,\i but this form was avoided because of its homonymousness with \I*ʔilχʷe-\i 'to die' (q.v.). For this reason the expected change *qʷ > *χʷ did not happen. This explanation seems more probable, because it involves irregularity only in one branch (PL).

A more recent loan from Nakh is Osset. \Iändärg\i 'silhouette' (the Iranian etymology in Abayev 1958, 156 < \I*ham-tanϑra-ka-\i is also not convincing).

Similar words are widely spread in many linguistic families, but the addressing form \I*dādā\i may well have existed also in PNC (correspondences between subgroups are basically regular). The root is usually reduplicated (although several languages reflect a non-reduplicated \I*dājV\i or a partially reduplicated \I*ʔādājV\i; cf. also HU: Hurr. \Iat:aj\i, Urart. \Iatǝ\i 'father', see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 25).     This stem certainly was not a basic name for either 'father' (which was most probably \I*ʔŏbV̄jV\i) or 'mother' (\I*ʔānVjV\i), but could possibly be used as a term of endearment for both parents.

As far as the Andian form is concerned, regularity of correspondences is violated (*j should not be preserved in PA), which is not surprising in a word like this. The PTs - PL parallelism, however, makes the PEC reconstruction probable.

It is also preserved in HU, cf. Hurr. \Iše-ni\i 'brother' (despite another etymology given in Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 43, the word most probably belongs here).     Two basic original forms must be reconstructed as \I*u̲-ɨ̆cˊ̲ĭ(jV)\i 'brother' (with frequent further development > \I*cˊ̲wɨ̆jV\i or \I*cˊ̲wĭjV;\i exactly this form is reflected, e.g., in PL and PWC), and \I*j-ɨ̆cˊ̲ĭ(jV)\i 'sister' (sometimes with a similar contraction > \I*cˊ̲ĭjV\i). The arisal of the new feminine class prefix *r- in the Eastern area led to a new formation \I*r-ɨ̆cˊ̲ĭ(jV)\i 'sister', reflected in Darg., Khin. and part of Lezghian languages.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 278, Rogava 1956, Balkarov 1969, Shagirov 1, Abdokov  1983, 87. Despite Charaya 1912 and Yakovlev 1941, Kartvelian words for 'brother' (Megr. \Iǯima,\i Georg. \Iʒma\i) and 'son' (\Išwili\i) have nothing to do with PNC  \I*=ɨ̆cˊ̲ĭ.\i

The root occurs only in compounds (primarily with \I*=ɨ̆cˊ̲ĭ\i 'brother /sister', but in Avaro-Andian languages also with some other kinship terms), which has made the correspondences not quite regular. The major irregularity is loss of glottalisation in Lak. (\I-qu\i) and PL (\I*-χ[a]r\i). Still, the complete parallelism of the components and the exact semantic match of reflexes make the etymology quite probable.

1763|*ʔV̄ƛ̣V|0|prince, master|*ʔāŁi|708||0||0||0||0||0||0||0|    Among modern languages the root is attested only within Nakh (an old borrowing from Nakh or some close language is probably Arch. \Ihal-lu\i / \Ihal\i 'master'). However, the root is no doubt archaic, because it has interesting parallels in HU: Hurr. \Iall-ae\i 'princess, queen', \I*allae-ɣǝ\i 'household' (borrowed in Arm. \Iaɫx\i 'family, household', \Iallae-χi-nnǝ\i 'housewife' ( > Arm. \Iaɫaxin\i 'serving woman, female slave'); Ur. \Ial-ae\i 'master, ruler', \Ial-awe\i 'great'. See Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 50.     The HU forms with the *-χǝ-suffix (voiced in Hurr. -ɣ-) are particularly interesting, because it seems that they were borrowed back into EC languages with the meaning 'slave': cf. Av., Cham. \Ilaʁ,\i Darg. \Ilaʁ,\i Lak. \Ilaʁ\i ( > Arch. (Mikailov) \Ilaχ-t:u\i 'obedient'), Tind. \Ilaʁa,\i Akhv., Kar. \Ilaʁe,\i God. \Ilaʁi\i 'slave', PL \I*laʁ\i > Arch. \Ilo\i (erg. \Ilaha\i) 'child'.

The EC-WC comparison (first proposed by Meˊszaˊros 1934, 377) seems quite plausible (however, Megr. \Iskua\i 'child' has of course nothing to do with it - see Shagirov 1, 231). Bouda's (1950, 294) comparison of the WC forms with Georg. \Imeq̇wisi,\i \Imoq̇wasi\i 'relative, near one' is much worse both phonetically and semantically. See also Abdokov 1983, 86 (Lezg. \Iχʷa\i : WC; we should note,  however, that other Lezg. forms cited by Abdokov go back to PEC \I*dwirχE\i q.v.).

In PL and PN it means 'one of two or several wives (relative to each other)', and this may well be the original meaning (changed to 'girl' in general in PTs). The meaning 'relative' in general observed in PA, however, may suggest another possibility: the stem may contain (in a shortened form) the numeral \I*q̇Hwǟ\i 'two' and may have originally meant generally "one of two relatives", with later development > "one of two wives". The meaning of the component *-mVŁwV is not clear.

We should note, however, that within EC the root is reflected only in PN and PA, which makes the reconstruction of vocalism and the initial laryngeal uncertain. The PWC form has a usual labial prefix, with a regular delabialisation *č̣ˊʷ > *č̣ˊ after it.

Abdokov (1983, 88) compares the Andian forms (with the secondary meaning  'parent-in-law') with Ad. \Iṣʷǝ-\i in \Iṣʷǝ-gʷāšˊ\i 'mother-in-law', \Iṣʷǝ-pšˊ\i  'father-in-law'. These forms, however, being quite isolated in WC, should be  rather analyzed as metaphoric compounds meaning originally 'fair princess'/  'fair prince'; at any rate, Ad. ṣʷ- (going back to PWC *c̣ʷ) can not  correspond to PEC *Ł̲.

Perhaps, original \I*=erz-\i in PD was influenced by \I*c̣a\i 'fire' and obtained a secondary glottalisation? In that case we should rather reconstruct \I*=ĕrʒ̲Ŭ\i for PEC.

Sum. \Išaˋgar\i 'hunger' [cf. especially the PWC form], Hitt. \Ikast,\i Afroasiatic: Sem. \I*gŝʕ,\i Cush. \I*gaʔaĉ-\i).

The root is close phonetically to \I*=ĭG̲wVr\i 'dry', and in some languages they tend to contaminate with each other; but generally the two roots are very well distinguished in most subgroups.

PN and PL have forms with dental prefixes (aspectual? - cf. also the durative Ablaut grade *-i- in PL); other languages have only prefixed class markers. As for the phonetic side, there are some problems with the medial resonant (perhaps we should reconstruct *-l-, not *-r-, to account for its loss in PL), and with the Dargwa reflex: we should expect lax *-x- in PD. Violation of the phonetic rule (*λw > PD *x(ʷ) in tense words) may have been caused by early delabialisation (cf. an analogous delabialisation in PL).     In some languages the root may have been influenced by PEC \I*-ăƛ̲wVn\i 'to resemble, be similar' (or even merged with it), but the two roots certainly are to be kept separate.     The earliest form of the root could have been \I*λ̲wVrĂ\i - this is suggested by the probable Hurr. match \Išir-\i 'to be equal, alike' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 49). The shape \I**=ă[r]λ̲wĂ\i must have been a result of adding prefixes (\I*=a-λ̲wVrĂ\i > \I*=a-λ̲wrĂ\i > \I*=arλ̲wĂ\i).

The EC-WC comparison seems probable, although not indisputable. The EC reconstruction is more secure, although Lak. -r- and PL *-r- corresponding to PA *-n- should be explained: most probably -r- penetrated here from a suffixed form \I*Hānʒˊ̲V-rV-\i (cf., e.g., Cham. \Ihanc̣i-ra-\i).     See Абдоков 1983, 150.

1807|*čHapV(-lV)|409|left||0||0||0||0|*čipil|688|*čaIpVl-|1202||0||0|    A Darg-Lezg. isogloss. The word has a certain resemblance to Pers. \Ičap\i 'left', and could be considered as an Iranian loanword (although the phonetic and morphologic side of this hypothesis raises several objections), if not for an obvious HU parallel: Hurr. \Išapχalǝ\i 'left' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 54), which makes the PEC reconstruction much more reliable.

Despite them, the etymology seems rather probable.     A similar root exists in WC: PWC \I*ḳʷaχˊIV\i 'to knead, mix' (PAA \I*ḳʷVħa-\i > Abkh. \Iaˊ-ḳʷaħa-ra,\i Abaz. \Iḳʷħa-ra\i 'to knead', PAK \I*ḳʷǝħa-\i > Ad. \I(zaxaʁa)-ḳʷǝħa-n\i 'to mix'), but the uvular -χˊI- here is a serious obstacle for the EC-WC comparison (unless we suppose that the the original form underwent assimilation as early as in PEC).
1809|*bHešwV|0|deaf||0||0||0||0|*baIš:ʷV-|689|*p:eIš:ʷɨ-|1203|beš|258||0|    Basically a PL root: the Darg. and Khin. forms can be explained as loans (respectively from Agul and Shakhdagh). The PEC antiquity is dubious.

Chech. \I=eq̇a\i 'hard, rigid'), but here it has completely merged (for phonetic reasons) with PNC \I*=ĭG̲wĂr\i 'dry, to dry' (q.v.).     As with many adjectival stems, the root is frequently reduplicated. EC and WC languages reflect both the simple and the reduplicated stem. In some subgroups (particularly, in Lezghian) the root was subject to complicated expressive transformations, but still the semantic and phonetic unity of the listed forms is beyond doubt.
1811|*Ł̲wĕrV|1296|hard; severe, stern|*luri-n|730|*ƛ̣:ʷarV- ( ~ -o-)|1163|*=ɨƛwV(-ru)|871||0|*-irk:(ʷ)V-l-|691||0||0|*pVŁˊV|571|    The EC-WC comparison seems rather probable (note also the recurrence of meanings 'hard' and 'severe, proud' in both subgroups of NC). The protoform can be reconstructed as \I*Ł̲wĕrV\i (without class prefixation) or as \I*=iŁ̲wĕrV\i (in the latter case the PTs and PD forms must be considered as most archaic). The initial labial in PWC (which has caused the usual dissimilative delabialisation of the following consonant) also can be regarded as a former prefixed class marker.

1814|*=alḳV|0|to limp, lame||0||0||0|w-alḳa|728|*=alḳa|694|*ʔalḳä-|1207||0||0|    The root is characteristic for the Eastern Daghestan area (Lak., Darg., Lezg.); its relationship to PEC \I*Hläk̲V̄\i (\I/*Hälk̲V̄\i) is not quite clear. Note also several forms with -n-: Chech. \Ilänḳa\i 'lame person', Lak. \Ilinḳ\i 'lameness', Arch. \Ilanḳ\i bos 'to limp, hobble' which may be borrowed from Pers. \Ilang\i 'lame' (but for the verbal root \I*=alḳV\i this is hardly the case).
1815|*gwVcˊV|0|lean||0|*gʷačV- ( ~ -o-)|1166|*gʷVš(:)V-|872||0||0|*k:očV-|1208||0||0|    The root is very sparsely represented; the Rutul word may belong here if the original meaning was 'lean; bad' (with a typologically frequent change > 'left'). Not very secure.
1816|*jēqwV|0|lean, undernourished|*jāqi ( ~ *jēqa)|731||0||0||0||0|*jeχʷV-|1209||0||0|    A Nakh-Lezg. isogloss.

(or vice versa), but one of these forms is still genuine. The PN form has a very specific structure - with a prefix *ni- and reduction of the second part. The prefix should be perhaps analysed as the PEC reflexive pronominal stem \I*HinV-\i - i.e. \I*HinV-c̣̲ăq̇V\i '(one's) own power'.

The original meaning must be reconstructed as 'to put', with many secondary semantic developments (especially in Nakh languages). In PTs we would rather expect a *-L:- - the development of a lateral obstruent to *-l- in PTs is rather unique and must be explained by dissimilation with the early added *g-preverb (the lateral fricative lost its usual velar timbre and changed into a resonant).
1824|*=a / =i|861|to be (an auxiliary verb)|*=u / =a|744|*ʔi|1188|*-i|1018|=u- / =i-|744|*=u|715|*ʔa / ʔi|1229||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. The stems \I*=a\i and \I*=i\i probably demonstrate the aspectual Ablaut *a/*i.
1825|*ʔima(n)-|249|to stay, to be||0||0||0||0||0|*ʔima|1230|=mä|270||0|    A Lezg.-Khin. isogloss. There are no traces of this archaic root in other EC languages, but there is a good HU parallel: Hurr. \Imann-,\i Ur. \Iman-\i 'to be' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 21).

The final -r was regularly lost in most subgroups, but is preserved in the Eastern area (Darg., Lezg., Khin.); cf. also HU: Urart. \Iu/or-\i 'to make, to work', \Iur-iš(i)χǝ\i 'instrument' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 63). The root demonstrates the Ablaut *a/i.

See Trubetzkoy 1922, 238 (listing also Av. \Iλ:i-ze,\i And. \Iλ:i-du\i - forms that we were unable to identify); in Trubetzkoy 1930, 278 the EC verb is incorrectly  compared with PAK \I*χʷǝ-\i 'to become' (see comments on p. 460).

The comparison with \I*=Hŏq̲̇Ē\i seems quite plausible semantically and phonetically.     A similar root exists in Kartvelian (Georg. \Iq̇a-w-\i 'to be, to have'); its comparison with WC see in Charaya 1912, 37, Lomtatidze 1956, 225, 228; the nature of its connection with the NC root is yet to be cleared up.

Correspondences are regular (in Khin. d- is a former preverb, while -n probably reflects the original *-l-conjugation). Ando-Tsezian forms (as well as some Lezgian) reflect a prefixless form with loss of *ʔi- in an unstressed first syllable.

In PD one would rather expect *c:-; preservation of glottalized *c̣ is due to early delabialisation. A reconstruction \I*c̣̲wǝfɨ̄\i is not excluded: in this case we can follow Abdokov (1983, 185) and compare PAT \I*c̣ʷaxǝ-\i 'to conceal, hide' (Abkh. \Iaˊ-c̣ˊ̌aχ-ra,\i Abaz. \Ič̣ʷaχ-ra\i).

PA \I*=icVn-\i and PL \I*ʔacan-\i point to *-n-conjugation, which has been lost in PD for some unclear reason. The vowel must be reconstructed as *-ā-, with an Ablaut reflex in PA (*-i-); -u- in PD is not quite clear.

The PN form is metathesized: \I*χāṭṭ-\i < \I*χānc̣-\i < \I*c̣ānχ-\i (probably with a secondary length, because other languages suggest rather a short vowel). All these irregularities are explained by the exceptional root structure *CVRCV, very rare for verbs.

Despite some influence of other verbal roots (see above), the root seems to be independent and the reconstruction looks rather probable. Note that the root has a laryngeal Anlaut and does not have prefixed class markers.

The EC-WC comparison was suggested by Trubetzkoy (1930, 278; see also  comments on p. 461).

The etymology seems reliable phonetically and semantically.

Cf. also Urart. \Iašj-\i 'to capture' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 36). Perhaps it would be better to reconstruct *-ǝ- as the main vowel (and to consider *-i- in PL as a later Ablaut grade). Since the meaning "to touch" occurs in EC languages, the comparison with PWC \I*sˊV\i (\I*šV\i) seems plausible, although loss of labialisation in PWC is still to be explained (there are several cases like that among verbal roots).

Kartvelian \I*tas-\i / \I*tes-\i 'to sow' is hardly related genetically: most probably it is a loan from early Nakh or Adygh. See Abdokov 1983, 180-181.

Aside from the problems in PL reconstruction (see above), the correspondence would be normal if there were no labialised reflexes in Av. and PL (on the other hand, for PEC \I*sˊ̲wVrV-\i we would expect š:- in Av., š(ʷ)- in Lak., *s:- in PD and *šʷ- in PL). The only possible solution is to reconstruct a verbal stem with a cluster *-wsˊ-, yielding independently labialised fricatives in daughter-languages.     Another possible solution would be to separate the PL form, which may be autonomously compared with PAK \I*za\i "turn round" (Ad. \Iʁa-za-n,\i Kab. \Iʁa-za-n\i etc.), see Абдоков 1983, 175.

Somewhat problematic is the relationship of PN \I*=aš-\i 'to melt, to thaw' (Chech., Ing., Bacb. \I=aš-\i): if it is cognate (which is not very certain), we should reconstruct PNC \I*=ĭrc̣wĂr; \isee also PEC \I*=is̲Vn-.\i Perhaps related is Urart. \Ic̣i-\i  'to flow, to rain' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 44) - although semantically not very secure.

It does not fit very well into the PNC root \I*=ĭc̣wĂr-\i q.v., but it also does not correspond quite regularly to the Lak. and Lezg. forms with -s:-. Perhaps we should reconstruct \I*=ic̲wVn\i (the reflex of *-c̲w- in PN is actually unknown and could well be -š-). The matter requires further investigation.

The root consonant behaves in a somewhat irregular manner: PA, Lak. and PD point to *šw (with tense phonation), but Avar and PL have unexpected hissing reflexes. This, together with the fact of variation between *-n and *-r-conjugation in PL, makes us suspect that contaminations of different roots have taken place. For the hissing *s (Av. \Is:ʷine,\i PL \I*ʔisʷVn-\i) cf. perhaps PEC \I*s̲iHwV\i 'breath, soul' - especially reflexes like Kar. \Is:uha˜-\i 'to get tired' (the semantic correlation 'breath, breathe' - 'extinguish' is typologically rather common).

1887|*jVḳVr-|0|to hurt, feel pain||0||0|*ḳoḳ-|923||0||0|*jiḳVr-|1281||0||0|    A Tsez-Lezg. isogloss, thus the vocalism is hard to reconstruct.

The etymology on the whole seems quite satisfactory, but there are some irregularities: in PD we would rather expect *z, not *c:. We may think that the root consonant here was expressively geminated (PD \I*ʔizz-\i > \I*ʔicc:-\i), and indeed we see traces of this gemination in Ak. \Iizz-es,\i \Iizz-ala.\i It is even possible that the gemination occurred as early as in Proto-Darg.-Lezg. - cf. a quite analogous gemination in Rut. \I=ädda-\i (normally -d- would be expected).     Cf. also Hurr. \Iazz-u/ošχǝ\i 'tabooed, impure, sinful, sick (or the like)', see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 40.     See Abdokov 1983, 136.

The verb has a very rare root structure (*HVRVCV), clearly seen in the reflexes; the second consonant is in most subgroups a reflex of *-w-, but Lak. has -r- and Andian has changing class infixes (-b-/-r-). Since such a root structure is quite unique for a verb, there are two equally acceptable solutions: to reconstruct *-w- (and consider Lak. -r- and And. -b-/-r- an innovation) or to reconstruct changing class infixes in PEC.

There exists a similar root in PEC - \I*=irq̲̇wVr\i 'to break, tear' (q.v.); the two stems may be connected by an archaic prosodic alternation.

It reveals a constant variation between -0 and -n-conjugations (in PA, probably also in PL); it is, therefore, not excluded that we deal here with a merger of two (or more) individual verbal roots (see above in the Andian part), which are now almost impossible to separate from each other. A possible old nominal derivate see under \I*ħG̲unu.\i

Initial laryngeal is suggested by the HU parallel: Hurr. χiz-lV- 'to roll up' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 43).

The Archi form looks archaic, but since there are no parallels in other Lezgian languages, and since the correspondence between Av.-And. and Archi is not quite regular (we would rather expect PL *qIʷ > Arch. χIʷ), a borrowing is not excluded. Perhaps we should regard as a genuine parallel to the Av.-And. form not Arch. \Ie=qIʷin-,\i but Rut. \Is-u=qIa-\i 'to shake, sway' (where -qI- regularly < PL *qIʷ).

Several languages have preserved the old derivate \I*swinV\i (\I*=aswinV\i) 'glue'. Labialisation as such has been lost in all reflexes (-u- in Arch. \Is:us:ǝ-\i may be a reminiscent of it), but can be securely reconstructed for the correspondence Av., PA, Lak. s : PD, PL *s:.

The Nakh languages also have a root \I*=ēbc-\i / \I*=ōbc-\i 'to knit, plait' (Chech. \I=ūc-,\i Bacb. \I=epc-,\i term. \I=opc-\i) which may reflect the same verbal stem (with the plural infix -b-, which superseded *-j- and prevented the development *-jcˊ- > *-sṭ-). Cf. also HU: Hurr. \Iχuž-\i 'to bind, to detain', Urart. \Iχuš-\i 'to annul (services), to stem (water)' (*'to untie'), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 40.

In Nakh languages the root \I*=āq(q\i)- 'to pull out' has also a meaning 'to dig out' and thus may reflect a merger of two roots: PEC \I*Harq̲wV\i 'dig' and \I*Hiq̲V(r\i) 'take, pull out' (q.v.).

The EC-WC comparison seems rather probable, despite the not quite regular correspondence PEC *ɫ : PWC *Ł. Resonants are normally lost in PWC, but in this case *ɫ was retained as the only possible element (because laryngeals were also lost, and probably even before the resonants), but was transformed into a voiced lateral affricate.

The PWC root, however, can belong either here or to \I*=imc̣̲Vn\i q.v. [We should note that the Av.-and. forms reflect rather a form like \I*=Häcˊ̲Ăw\i with non-labialised -cˊ-; it is not clear, which is original - \I*=Häcˊ̲wĂ\i or \I*=Häcˊ̲Ăw.]\i

This is, however, the only example of the correspondence EC *cw : WC *šʷ (in other cases WC has a voiced reflex *žʷ), thus the comparison is not very secure.

There are, however, some possible traces of the root in Lezgian languages: cf.

Another probable Lezgian parallel is Arch. \Iaƛa-s\i 'to put on (hand, finger)' < \I*ʔaƛ:V-,\i which could be a modification of original \I*ʔaƛ̣V-\i under the influence of another root, reflected in Arch. \I=ubƛa-s\i 'to put on (lower part of body)' < PEC \I*=ōmŁ̲V\i q.v.

The EC-WC comparison seems satisfactory both semantically and phonetically (although the reason for loss of labialisation in PWC is not quite clear: perhaps it is the other way round, and we should reconstruct \I*=agĂl\i with secondary labialisation in PEC - e.g., under the influence of the 1st class marker *u-). Shagirov (1,161) is of course right in refuting Balkarov's comparison of the Adygh form with Akhv. \Iž-\i (\Ižab-\i) 'to read' (Balkarov 1964, 100).

See Абдоков 1983, 177-178, 184.

1962|*ɫamV|879|licking, to lick||0|*lam-|1292||0|lanc̣a|818|*lemc̣|801|*lam|1350||0||0|    An expressive root with an exceptional phonological structure RVRV. The tendency to avoid such root structures probably had led to adding the suffix *-c̣V in the Lak-Darg. area. We can now only guess as to its original meaning: cf. perhaps PNC \I*=ic̣Ă\i 'to give, put' (cf. expressions like Rut. \Imiz wɨs\i 'to lick' = 'to give tongue' etc.). Anyway, it is hard to separate the And. and Lezg. forms (going back to \I*ɫamV\i) from Lak-Darg. (going back to \I*ɫVmc̣V\i).     The front vocalism in PD \I*lemc̣\i could have been conditioned by the influence of PD \I*mec:\i 'tongue' (see \I*mĕlʒ̲ĭ\i). It is interesting that the stem \I*lemc̣,\i in its turn, had influenced the root for 'tongue' in PD which gave rise to the coexistence of two stems: \I*mec:\i and \I*lec:mi\i (\I*lemc:i\i) in Dargwa dialects.

The problem of its NC antiquity is hard to solve; we may note that the correspondences are more or less regular (of course with some distortions, usual for onomatopoeic roots). See Абдоков 1983, 185.

The Darg. form is somewhat dubious (the PD reconstruction is not certain, and unclear is the loss of *-l-conjugation); still the Avar and Lezgian forms have to be separated from other similar roots.     There can be also reconstructed an expressive noun \I*G̲HwVlṭV\i 'a gulp, mouthful' - very probably derived from \I*HV̲lGwVl,\i with an expressive suffix *-ṭV. Cf. PN \I*q̇urṭ\i / \I*q̇orṭ\i (Chech., Ing. \Iq̇urd,\i Bacb. \Iq̇orṭ,\i \Iq̇lorṭ\i), Lak. \Iq̇Iulṭ,\i Darg. Chir. \IʁIurṭ.\i

Reconstructed for the PEC level, but spread only in the Eastern Dagestan area. The Lak. form contains a prefix da- ( < *ra-). The initial part (go-) of the Avar word \Igodeˊḳan\i could be somehow related; but this can not be asserted, unless we know the meaning of the second component (-deḳan).

A reverse direction is more probable in this case, although phonetic problems still remain). A special problem is the etymology of PL \I*ḳareṭ\i 'group, herd' (Tab. \Iḳereṭ,\i Ag. \Iḳaraṭ,\i Lezg. \Iḳereṭ\i): it can not be derived from \I*ɣwārdV̆\i ( > Arch. \Iʁat:ǝra\i) and may be, in fact, a secondary loan from Ossetian (Alanian).

It should be probably kept apart from a synonymous \I*c̲ifV\i (q.v.), but the two roots could have influenced each other (in particular, tense č:- in Lak. may be due to such a contamination); another source of influence can be seen in PEC \I*čHaχV\i 'to be wet, flow' (q.v.). We should also mention the common Darg. name for 'urine': Ak. \Ižiħ,\i Kad. \Ižeħ,\i Kharb., Tsud. \Ič:eħ\i < PD \I*č:eħ\i (or \I*č:eχI\i), which resembles the Lak. form in having a tense *č:-.

2005|*nV̆č̣ē (~,-ī)|1037|oak-tree|*nač̣|810||0||0||0||0||0||0|*pčˊ:V|644|    The root is well attested in PN and PWC, but has left no traces in most EC languages. Khaidakov (1973) cites two other forms: Lak. \Imaža\i 'oak-tree' and And. \Inoži\i id., but if they are genuine (the source is not very reliable), they must be ultimately borrowed from Nakh (see above about the reconstruction of *č̣ in PN, which later changed to -ž- (-ǯ-) in Chech. and Ing.).     Further connections of the root are not quite clear. Borrowing from the supposed Proto-Iranian \I*nauča-\i 'some coniferous tree' (see about this root under \I*ɦwmĭc̣̲Ĕ\i) is not very probable - both semantically (the root \I*nV̆č̣ē\i means only leaf-bearing trees in NC languages) and phonetically (because a glottalised *č̣ is reconstructed). Thus for the time being we prefer to regard this root as genuine - until further research is done.
2006|*ʔɨ̄rcV|1115|stick, wood|*ʔārcV|811||0||0||0|*ʔurcul(i)|818||0||0|*sǝ|709|    The comparison seems rather probable. We should note, however, that the  PWC form can equally well correspond to PEC \I*ħwäls̲ǝ̆\i 'wood, stick' (q.v.),  with which we compared PWC \I*pǝsV\i 'fir-tree' (in fact, such a comparison was  made by Abdokov 1983, 132) - and vice versa. This is conditioned by the merger  of *c and *s in PWC, as well as the loss of resonants and laryngeals.  Therefore, the final etymological solution is yet to be done.

Shugn. \Ibǝruǯ,\i Osset. \Ibärz\i / \Ibärzä\i 'birch-tree' etc.); but since the reflexes correspond to each other well phonetically, are present in distant EC subgroups and have substantially modified the original semantics, the borrowing should be probably dated by a very early (common EC) period.

The EC-WC comparison is phonetically satisfactory, but there are some semantic doubts: in PEC it is obviously some coniferous tree, while in PWC it is a leaf-bearing tree (asp, ash-tree or willow).

Reflexes of the root in some languages are very close to those of PEC \I*χħǟnɨ\i 'door, part of door' (q.v.), due to a merger of *q and *χ; but the two roots are certainly opposed.

In PC we have to assume an assimilation and metathesis (\I*ƛ̣iriṗ\i < \I*ʔirƛiṗ\i), not surprising in a complicated stem like this.

2030|*c̣ämc̣V|0|piece, crumb|*c̣inc̣c̣-|830|*c̣Vc̣V|1335||0|c̣inc̣|852||0||0||0||0|    An expressive reduplicated root. The development in PN is irregular (-nc̣- in Chech. instead of expected -tt-), which should be obviously explained by the root's expressive nature. The root is similar phonetically and semantically to \I*c̣ŏc̣V\i 'tip, spout' (q.v.), and the two roots could have merged in some subgroups.
2031|*χHakV|0|bat||0|*χ:aka-ra|1336||0|χ:aIčara-|853|*χIakim- ( ~ χ:I-)|826||0||0||0|    At least the Lak-Darg. parallel seems reliable (the And. form is known only from Khaidakov's dictionary, which is a rather unreliable source), but the original meaning is not quite clear: the meaning in Lak. ('raw hide; membrane') may be primary, or else it may be derived from 'bat' ('bat-like skin'). The word for 'bat' is not recorded in most EC languages, and we must wait for further data.

Still the NC reconstruction seems rather probable, and EC languages have probably lost the root because the particular beast of pray (jackal?), denoted by the root in PNC, was not spread in the mountains of East Caucasus.     It is interesting to note similar words in other languages of the East: cf. Sum. \Ipirig\i 'lion', Old Indian \Ivyāghraˊ-\i 'tiger' (whence Arm. \Ivagr\i) etc.

The word seems to be genuine at least in Ing., PL (where regular phonetic development took place) and Laki (the Lak. word has a tense -c:- which can not be explained if we assume a loan from Av., Darg. or Lezg. \Ikuc\i).     The Laki form (with regular weakening \I*kuc:\i > \Ikuc\i) is the most probable source for Avar \Ikuc\i 'measure, form; face' (whence Akhv. (cited from Khaidakov 1973) \Ikuči\i 'face'), and for Darg. \Ikuc\i 'appearance, form, build' (identical in all dialects: Ak., Ur., Muir., Sirg., Kub., Tsud. \Ikuc\i).

The root is widely represented in other Caucasian languages (Georg. \Ineswi\i 'melon' - later borrowed in Gunz. \Ineso\i id., Balk. \Inaša,\i \Inarša\i 'cucumber', Osset. \Inas\i / \Inasä\i 'pumpkin') - but all those forms are most probably North Caucasian loanwords (none of them can explain the appearance of -r- in PN). See the discussion in Shagirov 1, 935, Abayev 1973, 161.

Cf. also the reduplicated synonymous form \I*gălVgV\i q.v.: we keep the stems distinct, because they have separate reflexes in some subgroups, but \I*gălVgV\i most certainly is a reduplication of \I*gălV.\i

The semantic difference between these two roots is yet to be established (in Ubykh they are opposed as 'profit, pay' : 'price'; in PAA as 'price, buy' : 'pay'). Cf. also HU: Hurr. \Iniɣ-ari\i 'dowry' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 22).

It is interesting to note a probable HU parallel: Hurr. \Iardǝ\i 'town', Ur. \Iardi-nǝ\i 'the Town' (name of Muṣaṣir, the capital of Urartu), with the root structure reflex similar to PN (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 26). {It is also interesting to note Georg. χvedr- 'share, plot of arable land', perhaps reflecting an early PN form like *ɦudr- or *ɦwVdr-.}

2055|*bHǝ̄mṭV|113|duck|*bɦāṭ|843||0|*maṭV|987|baṭ|865|*baIṭ|829||0||0||0|    In most subgroups the word could be borrowed from Arabic \Ibaṭṭ\i 'duck' (since there are, of course, no domestic waterfowl in most modern NC communities); however, some phonetic peculiarities (especially nasalisation in Tsez.) make us think of the possibility of PEC reconstruction. Besides Arabic the word is known also in Georgian (\Ibaṭi\i 'goose'), where it may well be borrowed (either from Nakh or also from Semitic). The problem requires a further investigation.
2056|*ḳwVṭkwVṭV / *q̇wVṭq̇wVṭV|0|a k. of bird (probably woodpecker)||0|*ḳʷVṭḳʷVṭV|1349|*q̇ʷoq̇ʷoṭV|988||0|*q̇uṭq̇uṭi|830|*ḳʷVṭḳʷVṭ /*ṭVq̇ṭVq̇|1402|ḳaḳɨd|305||0|    An expressive reduplicated stem, reconstructed for the PEC level.

It may have denoted an aunt / uncle or his (her) family.

Medial -l- (based on the Lak. form) is not secure; Archi and PN speak rather in favour of *-j- (\I*cHōjGV\i), and Lak. -l- in this case may be a metathesis of a determinative suffix (\IcuIlq:a-\i < \I*cuIq:V-la-\i).

Medial -r- in Av.-And. is not quite clear (we would rather expect here a loss of medial resonant); also rather strange is the paradigm A in Avar (Nakh languages do not show any trace of laryngeals). These irregularities can be perhaps explained by interlingual borrowing - but in general the antiquity of the root is beyond doubt.

Unclear is the syllable *-kʷa- in PA, as well as the tense *s: in PL. Perhaps we should reconstruct here a rare cluster of two medial stops (\I*mV̆kwcV\i) or a trisyllabic structure, like in PA? Another solution may be provided by an isolated form, attested in Tsez. (Kid.): \Imekaχ\i 'hunger' - The PA form could be a compound \I*makʷac-\i < \I*makʷa-mac-\i (where the first component = Tsez. \Imeka-,\i and the second component = PN \I*maci-\i).

Therefore, medial -n- in Lak. must be secondary (on analogy with \IkuInṭa\i 'pit, small pit'), and the Urartian word is probably unrelated.

It had obviously signified some dying stuff for ornament (in WC the meaning shifted to the ornament itself - whence 'letter, document'). Phonetically the correspondence is quite satisfactory; perhaps, however, we should reconstruct \I*sˊämq̲̇ī\i with shift of labialisation in PWC (\I*sˊämq̲̇ī\i > \I*sˊwänq̲̇ī\i > \I*šˊʷǝqˊI:a\i) rather than suppose loss of labialisation in PEC (all EC form point to PEC \I*sˊänq̲̇ī\i). Of course, Abdullayev's treatment of the Darg. form as šin 'water' + q̇Ia 'roasted grain' (see Shagirov 2,136) should be considered as folk etymology.     The root has interesting parallels, particularly, in Semitic: Arab. \Isummāq\i 'Rhus coriaria L.', a plant used for dying into black). From Arabic it penetrated into Persian (\Isummāk\i), then through Turkic (Tat. \Isumax\i etc.) - into Ossetian \Is(y)mäg\i 'iron vitriol', and from Ossetian - into Georg. dial. \Ismagai\i id.

It is interesting to note that the original meaning 'axe' is preserved only in Dargwa, while Av.-And.-Tsezian languages changed it to 'stick' (having preserved their own words for 'axe', see \I*kwɨ̄rṭā,\i \I*ɦwālzˊV\i).

Avar has reduplicated the root, in PN (Chech.) the initial weak syllable was reduced (\I*lV-\i < \I*=iŁV-\i). Correspondences between EC languages allow to reconstruct a lateral root consonant *Łw, which corresponds to the lateral in PWC. The only problem is loss of labialisation in PWC (we would rather expect a form like \I*LˊʷV\i), which happens also in a number of other verbal roots - perhaps as a result of phonetic interaction with former class markers. See Абдоков 1983, 158.

The EC-WC comparison seems quite plausible phonetically and semantically.     In EC the root interacts actively with \I*=arq̇Vr\i 'to reach' and \I*=ǝ̆q̇wVn\i 'to be enough, sufficient', but there seems to be a good reason for keeping all these three roots apart.

The root belongs to a number of stems common to several linguistic families of the ancient Near East: besides IE and NC, cf. also PK \I*obol-\i 'orphan' (Климов 1965, 149-150).

(neither Av.-And., nor Lezg. have any trace of a nasal); otherwise correspondences are regular. The vowel in PA probably reflects the Ablaut grade *e ( > PA *o).

However, there is one irregularity: in PWC we would expect tense -c:- (because the correlation of root structures - PN *HVRCV : PL *mVRCV points to the original structure with long final vowel, \I*HmVrʒĀ\i).

Cf. perhaps also Darg. \Iharuš\i 'elderberry' (the  meaning in the Russian-Dargwa dictionary is given as 'millet beverage, bouza', but this is probably a misspelling: Russ. \Iбуза\i ('bouza') instead of \Iбузина\i 'elderberry').     Since gooseberry is a thorn-plant, it is tempting to compare the word with the Greek substratum word \Ikypaˊrisso-s\i 'cypress' (whence also Lat. \Icupressus\i), see Nikolayev 1985, 70.

If its Iranian etymology is correct (*spaϑa, see Abayev 1979, 92) - which, however, is somewhat dubious for phonetic and morphological reasons - we will have too acknowledge the Iranian origin of the gloss.

In [Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 62] the HU root is compared with Tsakh. \Iwuhur\i 'street', but since the Tsakhur word is absolutely isolated (the comparison - ibid. - with Chech. \Iūram\i 'street' should be certainly abandoned, because Chech. \Iūram\i is a recent borrowing from Turkic), we now prefer the comparison of HU \I*χāri\i with EC \I*ħarχi.\i

The PNC 1-st p. pronoun needs some comments. Like other personal ronouns, it is characterized by unique phonetic features (voiced fricative in NC, the development *z > *d in Av.-And.-Tsez., Darg. and Lak. /where *d > :/). However, forms with *d- certainly can not be kept apart from forms with z, since morphologically they match each other very well.      The  direct  stem  may be safely reconstructed  as  \I*zō,\i poradically  with  a  pronominal suffix *-n -  \I*zōn\i  (cf.  PA I*di-n,\i  PL \I*zo-n;\i on Lak. \Inu\i and Darg. \Inu\i see \I*nV\i). A possible race  of *-n is also the -ǝ vowel in PC: it probably reflects -ǝ˜ < *-ō-n with loss of nasalization (without it *-ɨ would be xpected  in  PC). The vowel -u- in Av. (\Idu-n\i) and Darg.  (\Idu\i) hould  best be explained by the influence of the 2-d p.  pro- oun q.v.      The  evidence of PN, PHU, PL and Khin. allows to recons- ruct  three different oblique stems for the 1-st p.  pronoun. he one is \I*zā-\i /PL \I*za-\i = PN \I*sa-(*sā-)\i/, the other - \I*ʔez(V)\i PL  \I*-ez\i  = PHU \I*(j)es-\i = PN \I*ʔas\i = Khin. \Ias\i/;  finally,  the hird  is \I*ʔiz(V)\i /PL gen. \I*-iz\i = Khin. \Ii/e\i/. It is most  pro- able that the third stem is reflected in Darg. \I*di-,\i PC \I*di-,\i A  \I*di-\i (where it lost the initial vowel and became the gene- al oblique stem). In Lak. and HU, where the obl. stem is \It:u-\i nd  \I*so-\i respectively, it is probably due to a merger of  PEC ir. \I*zō-\i and obl. \I*zā-.\i      We may present the following solution for this very complicated icture. The original ergative was \I*ʔez(V),\i preserved in PN as \I*ʔas;\i in HU it became also nominative (merging of erg./nom. in pronouns is rather usual n ergative languages). In PL and Khin. this stem shifted to dative - which is arallel to the general shift of the PEC ergative case in *-s̲V > PL dative -s: (note, however, that in Khin. the erg. form \Ijä\i probably still reflects he same stem  \I*ʔez(V)\i). The obl. stem \I*zā-\i then took upon itself rgative functions in PL. Finally, the original genitive stem \I*ʔiz(V)\i was reserved as such in PL, Khin and (with vowel loss) in PD, PA and PC; in all ther languages it was superseded by the general oblique stem \I*zā-\i sometimes even by the dir. stem \I*zō-\i).      To sum up: PEC (PNC) dir. stem \I*zō(-n);\i erg. stem \I*ʔez(V);\i gen. tem \I*ʔiz(V);\i general oblique stem \I*zā-.\i      See Trubetzkoy 1930, 273; Abdokov 1983, 137.  
2284|*nɨ̆|101|I (1st pers. pronoun)||0||0||0|na|40|*nu|59||0||0||0|    A Lak-Darg. isogloss. The etymology is not very reliable, because the forms are very isolated, and do not fit into the paradigm of the 1st person pronoun reconstructed on other evidence (see \I*zō\i).     If we compare the paradigm of the 1st p. pr. in Dargwa dialects, it becomes probable that PD \I*nu\i is a secondary development < \I*du\i (or, possibly, \I*du-n,\i cf. PL \I*zon\i): cf. Ak. nom. \Inu,\i erg. \Inuni,\i dat. \Inab\i vs. Chir. nom. \Idu,\i erg. \Idi-c:e,\i dat. \Idamī.\i Still, PD \I*nu-\i in the 1st p. plural \I*nu-š:a\i stays unexplained, as well as Lak. \Ina\i (also < \I*da-n\i or \I*t:a-n,\i cf. the obl. stem \It:u-\i ?).     An etymological possibility would be to consider the morpheme \I*nɨ̆\i as originally a collective plural pronoun: cf. its use in PD \I*nu-s:a\i 'we' (exclusive), \I*nu-x:a\i 'we' (inclusive), \I*nu-š:a\i 'you (plur.)', quite parallel to Av. \Ini-ž,\i \Ini-ƛ:\i and \Inu-ž.\i Its usage in the 1st person plural could have influenced the 1st person singular in Lak. and Darg., and this influence was strengthened by a chance of secondary nasalisation (e. g. PD \I*nu\i < \I*du-(n\i)).
2285|*uō|26|thou (2-d p. pr.)|*waj|121|*mi-n|158|*mǝ|136|wi-|304||0|*uo-n|2|wɨ|69|*wA|175|    Cf. also HU \I*we-\i (Hurr. erg. \Iwe-š,\i gen. \Iwe-we;\i not attested in Ur.). The same stem is used as a pronominal enclytic (Hurr., Ur. \I-w\i) and as a verbal ending of the 2-d pers. sing. (Hurr. -ū/-ō, Ur. -au).     The PN form is somewhat problematical: it is the 1-st p. pl. inclusive pronoun, and may belong here if this meaning is secondarily developped from "thou"(+"I").     The direct stem is easily reconstructed as \I*uō\i or \I*uō-n\i (cf. \I*zō,\i \I*zō-n\i for the 1-st pers.), with nasal assimilation in PA (\I*mi-n\i < \I*wi-n\i) and PC (\I*mǝ\i < \I*wǝ-n\i). One of the oblique stems (most probably genitive) was also formed from this root (cf. HU \I*we-/*-Vw, \iLak. \Iwi-\i /in Lak. the direct stem was replaced by another stem, \Iina,\i and only the original oblique stem was  preserved/, PL \I*-iu,\i Khin. \Iwi\i < PEC \I*ʔiuV-\i (or \I*ʔeuV-\i ). However, for other cases suppletive forms were used (\I*ʁwV̄-\i / \I*ʔŏʁwV-\i and \I*du-\i q.v.); PL \I*wa-\i and Khin. erg. \Iwa\i are probably innovations (by analogy with \I*za-\i in the 1-st person). See Trubetzkoy 1930, 273; Абдоков 1983, 140.
2286|*ʁwV̄|241|thou (obl. base)|*ħō|109||0||0||0|*ħu|115|*ʁu(-n)|1026|oχ|208||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. The stem originally formed part of the suppletive paradigm of the 2d person pronoun. We can securely reconstruct the oblique stem \I*ʔŏʁwV,\i reflected in PN erg. \I*ʔaħ,\i Tsakh. gen. \Ij-ɨʁ-\i and Khin. dat. \Ioχ.\i It was probably used in the ergative case (the shift to genitive in Tsakhur must be secondary, because the original 2d person genitive is more or less securely reconstructed as \I*ʔeu̲V-\i or \I*ʔiu̲V,\i see under \I*u̲ō\i). As for the stem \I*ʁwV̄-\i itself, it was either used as ergative or (interchanging with *uō) also as nominative.     The complete paradigm of the second person pronoun in PEC can thus be reconstructed as \I*u̲ō\i (nom., perhaps interchanging with \I*ʁwV̄\i), \I*ʔŏʁwV\i (erg.), \I*ʔeu̲V-/*ʔiu̲V-\i (gen.), \I*du-\i (dat.). There is, however, no guarantee that this situation reflects the common NC state of things, because Western Caucasian languages do not reveal any traces of the stems \I*ʁwV̄\i and \I*du-\i (reflecting only \I*u̲ō\i).

Some languages have preserved traces of alternating stems \I*ži(-n)\i (dir.), \I*ža-\i (obl.), \I*ʔižV\i (gen.). [There may have also existed an ergative form \I*ʔež-,\i but since the Nakh languages, usually preserving the archaic ergative pronominal stems, have lost this pronoun, it can not be reconstructed.]     In some languages (Lak., Ub., some Lezg. languages and Darg. dialects) this has become the only form of the 1st person plural pronoun (having superseded the old inclusive forms); in other languages (Nakh, Tsezian) the process was reversed and original exclusive forms were superseded by inclusive ones.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 273. Abdokov (1983, 137) strangely enough compares the Ubykh form \Išˊǝ-\i with the PEC inclusive \I*Lǟ,\i which is quite impossible for phonetic reasons.
2288|*Lǟ|533|we (1st p. pl. incl.)|*tχō|120|*ʔiƛ:i|232|*ilV A|135||0|*x:a|126|*Łä-n|152|ki-n|77||0|    This is a common EC inclusive 1st person plural pronoun. It is preserved as such in Av.-Andian languages, in some archaic Darg. dialects (Chirag), Khinalug and most Lezghian languages. In PTs it has superseded the old exclusive pronoun \I*ži\i and has become the only 1st person plural. The same process must have occurred in PN (where there is no trace of \I*ži\i) - the morpheme \I*Lǟ\i > \I*lχō\i > \I*tχō\i became the only 1st person plural pronoun. Later, however, a new inclusive pronoun (\I*waj\i - originally from the 2d sing. \I*u̲ō,\i "with you") was introduced in PN, and \I*tχō\i became, in its turn, exclusive.     The paradigm of \I*Lǟ\i can be reconstructed as \I*Lǟ-(n)\i (dir. - cf. PL \I*Łä-n,\i Khin. \Iki-n,\i PN \I*tχō\i), \I*La-\i (dat. - cf. PL \I*Ła-,\i PN \I*tχa-\i), \I*ʔīL-\i (gen. - PL \I*-iŁ-\i) and \I*ʔēL-\i (erg. - PN \I*ʔāχu\i). The Av.-And. and Tsez. forms for the most part reflect the original ergative (and/or genitive) stem.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 239; 1930, 273 (although there is hardly any  connection with PAT \I*ħa-\i 'we').

PN \I*ʔašV,\i and PL \I*-eǯʷ\i /shifted to dative, the same as with other pronouns/), \I*ʔizˊw-\i (gen., cf. PL \I*-iǯʷ\i), \I*zˊwă-\i (obl., cf. PL \I*ǯʷa-\i). PWC \I*sʷV\i (as seen from the non-palatalised *sʷ) reflects rather one of the non-direct stems.     As with other plural pronouns, Avaro-Ando-Tsezian languages also reflect a non-direct stem (gen. \I*ʔizˊw-\i or dat. \I*ʔezˊw-\i) with the class prefixes *w- or *u̲- (in Akhv. \Iuš-di\i). The initial nasal in Avar, PTs (and also PD) may reflect the original EC pronominal stem \I*nɨ̆\i (q.v.) (which could have possibly denoted collective plural); labial m- in some Avar dialects (cf. Chad. \Imuž\i) and PTs \I*miž(:)e\i is probably due to the influence of the 2d person singular pronoun (Av. \Imun,\i PTs \I*mǝ\i).     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 273; Abdokov 1983, 137-138.
2290|*dū|0|thou (obl. base)||0|*du-|1177|*dɨ- A|881||0|*-t(:)|705|*-it:-|1220||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level (there are no traces of this pronoun in PWC). The root is well preserved in the Western (Av.-And.-Tsez.) area, and has almost disappeared in other languages, except Archi and Darg. dialects. It must have been originally the dative stem in the complicated suppletive paradigm of the 2d p. sing. pronoun (dir. \I*u̲ō\i / \I*ʁwV̄,\i erg. \I*ʔoʁwV-,\i gen. \I*ʔiu̲-,\i dat. \I*dū-\i). It has preserved its function in Darg., shifted to genitive in PL (Archi; note that Arch. dative \Iwa-s\i is an obvious innovation), and became the general oblique stem in Av.-And.-Tsezian.
2291|*č[ŭ]|647|self, oneself (3d-4th class)||0||0||0|cu|739|*če- / ču-|709|*-ič(ʷ)|1222||0|*čʷǝ|578|    The opposition of \I*ʒˊĭ\i 'self' (1-2 cl., animated) : \I*čŭ\i 'self' (3-4th cl., unanimated) is well preserved in PL. Most other languages have preserved only one of these roots.     The development *č- > c- in Lak. is irregular (typical for pronominal morphemes, cf. \I*čwi\i 'who, what' > Lak. \Icu-,\i \Ici-\i). It is unclear also, whether we should relate here PN \I*šā\i '(one)self' (Chech. \Išā,\i Ing. \Iše,\i Bacb. \Iša-jrwa\i) - phonetically absolutely irregular [perhaps it should be rather compared with PL \I*šä-\i 'demonstr. pronoun, that'].     The semantics of the PAT subject version is well explained if we assume its origin from a pronoun; the phonetic side is quite satisfactory.
2292|*HinV-|427|self, reflexive pronoun (obl. base)||0|*ʔin-|1178|*hin-|882||0||0||0|häh- / hähin-|269||0|    A common Av.-And.-Tsezian morpheme, with only sporadic parallels from other languages. Besides Khinalug, possible traces of this root can be perhaps found in Arch. \Iinž\i 'self' (where -n- is absolutely superfluous if we talk about reflexes of \I*ʒˊĭ\i q.v. - thus it may be an old compound of \I*HinV-\i + \I*ʒˊĭ\i).     If this morpheme is not an Av.-And.-Tsez. innovation, it must have played the role of the oblique base of one of the PEC reflexive pronouns (see \I*ʒˊĭ\i and \I*č[ŭ]\i).
2293|*ʒˊĭ|644|self, oneself||0|*ži-|177|*ž:V|216||0||0|*=iž|398||0|*zˊǝ ( ~ z-)|484|    A common NC reflexive pronoun; the EC and WC forms were first compared by Trubetzkoy (1930, 274). See also Абдоков 1983, 140. PL preserves the paradigm of this pronoun in the most detailed form: as seen from the Lezghian evidence, \I*ʒˊĭ\i was originally an oblique stem (followed by class and case suffixes), while the direct stem was \I*-ĭʒˊV\i - i. e., most probably, the same \I*ʒˊĭ,\i but with prefixed class markers.         Av.-And.-Tsezian languages use the stem \I*HinV-\i (q.v.) as the oblique stem. It is possible that \I*ʒˊĭ\i was a general oblique stem, while \I*HinV-\i was used in the dative/genitive cases.
2294|*x̲V|526|interrogative pronoun (who, what)|*χa|119|*λ:i-|316|*λ:u- /*λ:i-|138||0||0|*λ:i / *λ:ʷi|122||0|*xA|196|    The vocalic reconstruction is somewhat uncertain (probably, due to old Ablaut). We may note that this interrogative stem is mostly (although not always) used in oblique cases, notably ergative.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 239; 1930, 274.
2295|*hī, *hī-nV|12|interrogative pronoun|*ħā-|394|*hi-/*ʔi-|162|*hi- A|213||0||0|*hi- / *ha-|700|ja|78|*-a|190|    One of several interrogative stems reconstructed for PEC. It has a general interrogative meaning and is most often used in oblique cases.         The root \I*hī-\i is frequently encountered in combination with *-nV-, probably as an oblique stem construction \I*hīnV-\i 'whose, which, what'. We have mentioned above the secondary development \I*hīnV-\i > \InV-\i in some Lezgian languages, but the same process probably had taken place in other languages too. Cf. PA \I*(h)i-n-\i (in \I*(h)in-da\i 'when' > And. \Iinna-l,\i Cham. \Iinna,\i Tind. \Ihin-da-la,\i God. \Iin-da-q:i,\i \I*(h)inV-l\i 'where' > And. \Iinu-l,\i Tind. \Iini-la\i etc.) = PTs \I*hɨ˜tǝ\i   / \I*nitǝ\i ( < \I*hini-tǝ\i ) 'when' (Inkh. \Iito,\i Tsez. \Ineti,\i Gin. \Inete,\i Bezht. \Inito,\i Gunz. \Ihɨ˜dǝ\i), PTs \I*na\i / \I*nija\i 'where' (Inkh., Tsez. \Ina,\i Gin. \Ini,\i Bezht. \Inā,\i Gunz. \Inijo˜\i). It is significant that an identical combination \I*-a-nǝ-\i is also attested in WC languages: PAT \I*-anǝ-\i 'when' (a verbal infix > Abkh. \I-an(ǝ)-,\i Abaz. \I-an(ǝ)-\i), Ub. \Ianaˊ-(n)\i 'at the time, when...". We can thus safely reconstruct the morpheme combination \I*hīnV-\i for the PNC level.

It is used mostly for animated (more rarely - for unanimated) objects in EC languages, but has become an interrogative modifier in PWC (PAT). See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274.
2297|*ʡǟdV|552|thing; interrogative pronoun||0|*[h]idV|918|*hɔdV (~ ħ-, -a-)|470||0||0||0|de-l|309|*t:V|681|    Cf. also HU: Hurr. \Iedǝ\i 'body, thing', Ur. \Iedi-\i 'thing' (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 26). It is not quite clear which meaning is original - 'thing' or 'what', because both are rather widely reflected.     We should also mention a quite isolated form: Lak. \Ita\i 'when', which has an irregular devoiced t-, but possibly reflects the same EC root.
2298|*s̲āj|23|interrogative pronoun (what)|*sṭē-n-|190|*s:u-n-|269|*s(:)V- (~z-)|140|s:a-|124|*s(:)e|127||0||0|*sA (~ *š-)|192|    The common NC inanimate interrogative pronoun. Its usage in most EC language shows that it was originally used only as the oblique base.         See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274, Абдоков 1983, 139.
2299|*čwi|362|an interrogative pronoun||0|*ču-, *čo-mi|161|*š:ɔ-mɔ|212|ci, cu|91|*čV-|129|*šʷi|95|č:u, č:i-m|232||0|  Reconstructed for the PEC level. As an independent pronoun this root probably served for the direct base of the inanimate pronoun 'what'; it also served as the root of the derived PEC \I*čw[ĕ]-mV\i 'how much' and in some other derived interrogative pronouns.
2300|*kwi|0|who, which (interrogative pronoun)||0|*kV-|174||0|-ku-|461|*kV-|621|*kʷi|253|k-la|80||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. This pronoun is not widely spread and must have had restricted usage in PEC; however, it certainly must be reconstructed.
2301|*mV|426|an interrogative stem|*mV|124|*ʔi-mV|160||0||0|*mu-rt|708|*mo-sa|367||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. The same stem possibly can be discovered in Lak. \Icu-ma\i 'who, which' (a compound with \Icu\i 'who'). Note a striking parallelism between PL \I*mo-sa\i 'when' and PN \I*ma-ca(n\i) id.         [Since initial \I*mu-\i must be regularly dropped in Lak., it would be possible to derive Lak. \Ita\i 'when' < \I*mu(r)-ta\i = PD \I*mu-rt\i].
2302|*tV|0|that (demonstrative pronoun)||0||0||0|ta|80|*tV-|113|*tV|135||0||0|    This demonstrative root (used for far deixis and opposed to \I*dV\i q.v.) is common for the Eastern Dagestan languages (Lak., Darg., PL). A trace of it in the Western area is perhaps PTsKh \I*ti-λ\i 'inside' > Tsez., Gin. \Iteλ\i (the adverb "inside" is often built from pronominal stems, cf. Av. \Ižaˊ-ni-b,\i PA \I*ħi-nV\i etc.).
2303|*ʔŏ|954|that (demonstrative pronoun)|*ʔo|32||0||0||0||0|*ʔa|134||0|*a|126|    This demonstrative stem is mostly used for far deixis ("that") as opposed to \I*ha-\i (q.v.) for near deixis or emphatic deixis. We must note, however, that in many modern languages it is extremely complicated to make a clear-cut distinction between the reflexes of these two pronominal morphemes.         See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274; Абдоков 1983, 140.
2304|*dV|405|that (demonstrative pronoun)|*da-|107|*dV-|233|*dV|156||0||0|*dV|1221|du|68|*da|171|    One of several common NC deictic stems. The original meaning of \I*dV\i seems to be "that" with neutral space status (on the same level as the speaker). Cf. also Khin. \It:ʷa\i (with emphatic tenseness) 'there (on the same level as the speaker)'.     Because of the clearcut opposition in PL (\I*dV\i - \I*tV\i) we must distinguish this root from PEC \I*tV\i q.v.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274 (comparing also Av. \I=aṭaˊ\i 'other, separate' -   which hardly belongs here); Abdokov 1983, 138.
2305|*ʁV|0|a demonstrative pronoun||0|*ʁV-|234||0||0||0|*ʁu-|402|ʁi|215||0|    The identity of the Av., PL and Khin. stems is obvious, although it is rather hard to reconstruct the precise function of this pronoun. In PL it is used to denote objects located higher than the speaker; in Avar - rather vice versa (it is either a neutral third person pronoun or denotes objects located lower than the speaker). Cf. also Khin. \Iq:ʷa\i (with emphatic tenseness, the same as in \It:ʷa\i < \I*dV\i) 'there (below the speaker)'.
2306|*zˊwV|0|a pronominal (demonstr.) stem; thing||0|žo|917|*žV (~*ž:-)|152|za|558||0||0||0||0|    A not quite clear case. The Av. and Lak. forms probably belong together; it is less clear with the PTs pronominal stem \I*žV-.\i Still, the etymology seems possible, because abstract words denoting 'thing' in EC languages are quite frequently derived from pronouns (mostly, however, interrogative: cf. cases like Tsez. \Išebin,\i Inkh. \Ihimon\i 'thing' etc.). It seems worth noting also an obscure element in some East Daghestanian pronominal stems: Lezg. \Iwu-č,\i Tsakh. \Ihi-ǯo\i 'what'; Khin. \Isä\i 'that' (inanim.'; Darg. -š in \Ii-š\i 'this' - possibly reflecting (with some distortions) the same pronominal stem.
2307|*gV|210|that (below the speaker)||0|*gV-|1063|*gV|155|ga|654|*ʔi-ɣ|707|*gi-|353||0||0|    Reconstructed for the PEC level. The original spatial meaning of this deictic morpheme is well preserved in most languages. Note the voiced reflexes in all the Eastern Daghestanian languages (an irregular development, restricted to deictic and expressive morphemes).
2308|*bV|584|emphatic deictic particle||0||0|*bV|157||0||0||0||0|*bǝ|170|    A Tsez-WC isogloss; not very reliable because of rarity of reflexes. It is not excluded that this is the same morpheme as the class marker \I*b-\i (q.v.).
2309|*ʔi|520|this|*ʔi|96||0|*ʔi-/*ji-|58||0|*ʔi-|114|*ʔi|108||0|*jA|173|    A common NC demonstrative stem, in the majority of languages used for near deixis, thus the meaning "this" may be safely reconstructed. See Abdokov 1983,  138.

In some Eastern languages (Lezg. and Khin.) the root tends to mean 'that (above the speaker)'. See Абдоков 1983, 139-140.
2311|*mV|428|a demonstrative pronoun (this,that)||0||0|*mV|258|mu|152||0|*mV|107||0|*mǝ-|172|    The vocalism is hard to reconstruct (because of morphological restructuring in daughter-languages). The root is represented widely enough to justify its reconstruction for PNC.         See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274; Абдоков 1983, 139.

It is possible that the monosyllabic structure \I*cHǝ̆\i itself is a contraction < \I*cǝħV\i or \I*ħǝcV\i - in which case the PTs form should be considered as the most archaic one. Cf. also š(V)- in Urart. \Iš(V)-usǝ\i 'first', as well as HU \I*suj-\i > Hurr. \Išui(-ne),\i Urart. \Išuinǝ\i 'all, every' (cf. a similar semantic development in several EC languages), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 38.     See Trubetzkoy 1930, 274; Абдоков 1983, 153.

The PWC form has a prefixed dental; this may be an innovation, but may also reflect the common NC state (\I*tq̇Hwǟ\i with simplification of the initial cluster in PEC). See Абдоков 1983, 153.
2316|*nä̆wš̲i|596|two; a 2-year-old animal|*ši(n)|115||0||0|nuwš:a|168||0|*nušaj (~-iw-)|472||0|*nǝčˊǝ|223|    An interesting case. The root must have originally meant simply "two" and formed part of the suppletive paradigm of the PNC numeral "two" (\I*ṭq̇Iwä\i - \I*näwš̲i\i). The original meaning is preserved in PN and HU: cf. HU \I*šin\i 'two' > Hurr. \Išin-,\i Ur. \Išî-šǝ\i ( < \I*šin-(i)šǝ\i), see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 37.     (Note that both in PN and HU the root is metathesized). But probably already in PNC the root was used also to denote a two-year-old animal; it is only the latter function in which it was preserved in most modern languages. The Nakh languages present here an important link, because they have preserved the root in both functions. Phonetically the comparison is satisfactory (PL has a form with a frequent *-j suffix; weakness of -š- should be best explained by an intermediate form \I*nišʷaj\i < \I*niwš:-aj\i). Some problems are raised by -čˊ- in WC (instead of the expected -šˊ-; perhaps the affricate reflects here the rare Inlaut combination -wš:- ?).
2317|*ƛHĕ|0|three||0|*ƛob-|420|*λ:ɔI- A|317||0|*ħab-|221|*λep:ɨ-|535||0|*λ:V|257|    Some languages (PA, PD, PL) contain the final labial *-b- which is obviously an original plural suffix (there is no trace of it in the PC and PWC forms).         The strengthening *λ > *λ: in PWC is in this case possibly related to the loss of laryngeal (the presence of which is confirmed by the PC and PD forms); regularly we should expect a weak *λ (the vowel is short in PEC). Besides, the EC evidence points to a front *e vowel in the root, while in WC there is no palatalization. Maybe we should reconstruct some vowel variation in this root for PNC. In any case, the common origin of the word for 'three' in PEC and PWC is indisputable.         See Trubetzkoy 1922, 238, 243; 1930, 274; Абдоков 1983, 154.
2318|*sˊ̲wimHV|157|three||0||0||0|šam=a|729||0|*š(ʷ)imV|1210|pšʷa|260||0|    A rather interesting Eastern Daghestanian root: all the listed forms for phonetic reasons can not be traced back to PEC and PNC \I*ƛHĕ\i 'three'. It is probable that in PNC we must reconstruct two pairs of numerals for 'three' and 'four'; the semantic difference between them is still to be established.     In the case with \I*sˊ̲wimHV\i it is also interesting to point out the Kartvelian word for three which is PK \I*sam-\i (see Klimov 1964, 161; despite several authors - Bork 1907, 23-24, Lafon 1952, 64, Klimov ibid. - the PK root can be hardly compared with PNC \I*ƛHĕ,\i but is a rather good match for the local EC \I*sˊ̲wimHV\i).

The final -ʔ in PN has a double nature: it also may be a reflex of the lost *-q̇-, but it has been anyway confused with the final -ʔ which in PN marks all numerals (\I*cħaʔ,\i \I*šiʔ,\i \I*qoʔ\i etc.).     Class prefixation in the EC numeral "four" is preserved only in PN and PA (but not Avar); PL *j- may also be a trace of the class marker.
2320|*f̲ɦä̆|1196|five|*pχi(ʔ)|733|*ʔin-š:-tu-|1169|*λ:i-nɔ B|874|χ:uI-|731|*xu-|697|*λ:ʷe-|1212|pxu|262|*s-xʷǝ|572|    The WC form has a prefix of unknown origin; despite this, and the lack of the expected palatalisation (*-xˊʷǝ would be rather expected), there can be no doubt in the common origin of the EC and WC forms. The rules of palatalisation are violated in WC numerals (cf. also EC \I*ƛHĕ\i 'three' : WC \I*λ:V\i), possibly because of original Ablaut.         See Trubetzkoy 1922, 239, 243; 1930, 274-275; Абдоков 1983, 155.

Vocalism in PL, Lak., Av. and part of Andian languages (diverging from the normal reflexation of *ǟ) is due to the influence of \I*ʡĕrŁ̲ɨ̆\i 'seven' (see below about its influence on the WC form, too).     In WC labialisation is obviously secondary (as in some other cases, it must be explained by former class prefixation: \I*uV-ƛˊV\i > \I*ƛˊʷV\i). It is more difficult to explain the lack of expected gemination in *ƛˊ: (the EC data point to the final long vowel); maybe this was caused by analogy with the following NC numeral, \I*ʡĕrŁ̲ɨ̆\i 'seven' q.v. Still, the common origin of the EC and WC forms is beyond doubt.         See Trubetzkoy 1922, 239, 242; 1930, 275; Абдоков 1983, 155-156.

It is also attested in HU: although the normal Hurr. word for 'seven' is \Išitta-\i (a Semitic loanword), the old root may be discovered in Hurr. \Ifāīrǝ\i ( < \I*wa(H)er-\i) "the seven stars, the Pleiades" (see Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 20).  In most NC subgroups (including HU) this numeral reveals a reflex of the old class marker *u̲- (\I*u̲ʡĕrŁ̲ɨ̆\i); labial *b- in PWC is also a trace of the class prefix. Special phonetic comments: in Lak. \Iarul\i < \I*ʔarl-\i (insertion of a parasitic vowel between two liquids); the uvular reflex in PD is due to the lost laryngeal; in PWC palatalisation of *Lˊ is secondary (there does not exist a non-palatalised *L in PWC). Otherwise all correspondences are regular.     See Trubetzkoy 1922, 241, 243; 1930, 275; Абдоков 1983, 152.

Lak. \ImaIj-\i is probably a transformation of \I*maIlj-\i < \I*mali-\i (the source of pharyngealization is not clear). In  Khin. the root has been transformed under the influence of the numeral "seven" (Khin. \Ijiḳ\i). In Darg. k: is the normal reflex of *Ł; however, the reduction of initial labial and the source of *-ħ- is not yet clear (maybe *k:aħ- < *k:aI- is a result of a secondary transformation of *aIk:- which, in its turn, had been formed under analogy of *-arʁI- 'seven' from the original *mak:- ?).         A very probable parallel is Hurr. \Imiri\i - a numeral from the first ten (it can be either 'five', 'six' or 'eight'). If it denotes 'eight', it matches very well with PEC \I*bǖnŁ̲e\i ( > \I*mǖŁ̲e\i > \Imiri\i with a regular reflex -Ł- > -r-).         See Trubetzkoy 1922, 242.

The PL form contains a former class prefix *u̲-; other subgroups have either lost it or reflect a prefixless form. The vocalic correspondences are irregular just as they are in \I*u̲ĕnc̣ɨ\i 'ten' (q.v.). This is due to the mutual influence of these numerals in most subgroups: nevertheless, Laki, Avar and Dargwa reflect the opposition (*-i- in 'nine', *-e- in 'ten') very well.         One is tempted to compare the EC forms with PAT \I*zʷǝ\i 'nine' (as it was done by Trubetzkoy 1930, 275, Абоков 1983, 156). PAT \I*zʷǝ,\i however, corresponds well to Ub. \Ibʁˊǝ\i and PAK \I*bʁʷǝ\i 'nine', allowing to reconstruct PWC \I*bɣˊʷǝ\i q.v. - and the comparison of \I*ʔĭlc̣ˊwɨ\i and \I*bɣˊʷǝ\i meets serious phonetic obstacles.

Reflexes in several EC subgroups reflect class prefixation (*u- or *j-); in PWC the initial labial also goes back to a class prefix (with assimilatory labialisation of the following affricate, as in a number of other cases). See Trubetzkoy 1930, 275; Абдоков 1983, 156.     In PEC the same root was also used in a contracted shape \I*-c̣ĕ-\i as part of names of tens, cf.:         PL \I*-c̣V-\i > Tab. \I-c̣u-r\i (\Isimi-c̣u-r\i 'thirty'), Rut. \I-c̣ɨ-r\i (\Ixib-c̣ɨ-r\i id.), Tsakh. \I-c̣a-lˊ\i (\Ixeb-c̣a-lˊ\i id.);         PD \I*-c̣a-li\i > Ak. \I-c̣a-li\i (\IħaIb-c̣a-li\i 'thirty'), Chir. \IʕaIb-c̣a-le\i id.;         Lak. \I-c̣a-l\i (\Imuq̇-c̣a-l\i 'fourty' etc.);         PA \I*-c̣o-\i > And. \I-c̣o-l-\i (\Iλob-c̣o-l-gu\i 'thirty'), Cham. \I-c̣a-\i (\Iλaλa-c̣a-da\i id.), Tind. \I-c̣a-\i (\Iλaba-c̣a-ja\i id.), Kar. \I-c̣a-da\i (\Iλaba-c̣a-da\i id.), Botl. \I-c̣a-li-\i (\Ihabu-c̣a-li-da\i id.), Bagv. \I-c̣a\i (\Ihaba-c̣a\i id.), God. \I-c̣a-li\i (\Iλabu-c̣a-li\i id.).         Hurrian has replaced the numeral 'ten' by the word \Ieman\i (of unknown origin), but has retained the root in \Iki-ži\i 'thirty' (\Iki-\i 'three'); names of other tens are unknown. See Diakonoff-Starostin 1986, 46.

In PN the initial dental is possibly a trace of an original class prefix (it can hardly be explained in any other way). The only subgroup which has lost this archaic numeral is Andian (where 'twenty' is formed by 'two' + 'ten').

In PL and PAand. the root has a class prefix *w- (in PAand. it has replaced the original r-: we would expect in PA \I*rišo-\i as a regular reflex of the structure *HRVCV̆); we should stress that in PD and Lak. initial d- and t:- are not class prefixes, but regular protheses in this phonetic structure.
