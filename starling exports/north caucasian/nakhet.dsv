2|*ʁaʁa|1480|coat of mail|ʁaʁa|ʁaʁ||    3d class in both languages.
3|*jobq̇|364|ashes|juq̇|joq̇|joṗq̇|   Obl. base \I*ʔabq̇u-r-,\i cf. Chech. \Iʔovq̇ara-n,\i Ing. \Iʔovq̇aro,\i Bacb. \Iʔaṗq̇ajr-i.\i 4th class in all languages.
4|*kābst (~-ṭ)|415|bark (of a tree)|kowst|kɔst||    Obl. base \I*kābstV-\i (Chech. \Ikowsta-n,\i Ing. \Ikoasto\i); 4th class in Chech. and Ing.
5|*čVwV|416|1 in, inside  2 belly|čō 2, čȫ 1|čē 2|čuw 1|   The pure root is observed in Chech., Ing., Bacb. \Iču\i "in, inside". Other forms are derivates: cf. Chech. \Ičō\i "belly", \Ičȫ\i "inside" ( = Khild. \Ičʷjē,\i Ing. \Ičē\i), Ing. \Ičuʔa\i 'inside (n.)', Bacb. \Ičuw\i "inside, intestines", \Ičuwa\i "own house, dwelling". Cf. also a further derivate \I*čVwe-r-\i > Chech. pl. \Ičǖr-aš\i 'intestines', Ing. \Ičur-aš\i 'offal'.
6|*gagV|483|belly, stomach|gaj, gē|gĳg|gagaʔŏ|   Ing. \Igĳg\i goes back to \I*gag-iḳ.\i Vowel length is unclear (the Ing. obl. base \Igägo\i has a long ǟ, but it may be due to the loss of *-g-). 3d class in all lan- guages.
7|*=aqqu-n|418|big|=oqqa|=oqqa|=aqqõ|
8|*ʔālꭓVʒur|419|bird|olꭓazar|ɔlꭓazar|alꭓaʒur|    Bcb. form quoted from Matsiyev's dictionary. 3d class in Chech. and Ing.
9|*ħāc̣u|7|1 sparrow  2 bird|ħōza 1|ħazilg 1|ħac̣uḳ 2|    Ing. and Bacb. forms reflect PN diminutives \I*ħāc̣u-ḳ,\i \I*ħāc̣a-liḳ.\i Cf. also Chech. (Usl.) \Iħōzu,\i Cheb. \Iħāzu\i etc. 3d class in all languages.
10|*ꭓ-aʔ-|88|sit (down)|ꭓaʔ-||ꭓaʔ-|    PN paradigm: term. \I*ꭓ-aʔ-,\i dur. \I*ꭓ-ēʔ-\i (Bacb. \Iꭓeʔ-\i). An old Ablaut grade \I*ꭓ-oʔ-\i can be seen in Chech. \Iꭓ-oʔ-,\i Bacb. \Iꭓ-oʔ-\i 'to fit in (somewhere)' (intr.).
11|*q-aħ-|32|to bite|||q-aħ-ar|    Attested only in Bacb. (with the preverb q-), but having probable external parallels. With another preverb, *l-, cf. Bacb. \Ilaħ-ar\i 'to eat (together with smth.)' (term.), \Ileħ-ar\i id. (dur.).
12|*ʕārč̣i-|11|black|ʕärža|ʕärža|ʕarč̣ĩ|    Cf. Cheb. \Iʕāržĩ,\i Khild. \Iʕēržĩ\i etc. The vowelless base \I*ʕārč̣-\i is preserved in Chech. \Iʕarž-dan,\i Bacb. \Iʕarč̣-dar\i "to paint black".
13|*c̣ēgi|420|blood|c̣ĳ|c̣ĳ|c̣ejgĭ|    3d class in all languages. The same root is reflected in PN \I*c̣ēge-(n)\i "red" > Chech. \Ic̣e-n,\i Ing. \Ic̣e,\i Bacb. \Ic̣egẽ.\i
14|*d(e)ʡeꭓk (̃-ḳ)|129|bone|däʕaꭓk|ṭeꭓk||    4th class in Chech., Ing. Cf. also Kharach. \Ideʕaꭓk,\i Pharch. \Iṭeꭓk.\i
15|*nāqa|304|breast|nāqa|naqa||    6th class in Chech., Ing. Obl. base \I*nāqi-\i (Chech. \Inēqa-,\i Ing. \Inäqo\i).
16|*ṭāra|421|1 nipple 2 breast, nipple|ṭāra 1|ṭar 1|ṭar 2|    Obl. base \I*ṭāre-\i (Chech. \I\Iṭēra-,\i\i Usl. \Iṭēri-,\i Ing. \Iṭaro\i). 6th class in Chech., Ing., 7th class in Bacb.
17|*=āḳ-|422|to burn|=āg-|=ɔg-|aḳ-dar|
18|*mʡāra|18|claw, finger-nail; hook, fork|mʕāra|mʕara|mʕajrĭ|    In Chech. there exists a parallel form \Imaʕar\i which is obviously secondary. The obl. base should be reconstructed as \I*mʡāre-\i (cf. Chech. \Imʕēra-,\i Ing. \Imʕara-,\i Bacb. \Imʕare-\i). Belongs to the 4th class in the meaning "nail, claw", but to the 6th in the meaning "hook".
19|*marꭓo|78|cloud|marꭓa|morꭓ||    4th class in both languages.
20|*doꭓḳ|423|1 fog 2 cloud|doꭓk 1|doꭓk 1|doꭓḳ 2|    Obl. base \I*daꭓḳi-,\i cf. Chech. (Uslar) \Ideꭓki-,\i Ing. \Ideꭓko.\i 3d class in all languages.
21|*pšā|331|1 ice 2 spring, brooklet|ša 1|ša 1|pša 1,2|    Obl. base \I*pšē-\i (cf. Chech. Usl. \Išē-ŋ\i). 5th class in Chech. and Bacb., but 6th class in Ing. There exists a derivate from this root: PN \I*pšē-l\i "cold (n.)" (cf. Bacb. \Ipšel,\i Chech. \Išel-dan\i "to cool", Ing. \Išel-de\i id.), \I*pšē-li-(n\i) "cold (adj.)" (Bacb. \Ipšelĩ,\i Chech. \Išīla,\i Ing. \Išīla\i).
22|*=aʔ- (~ -ā-)|161|to come|=ā-n|=a-n|=aʔ-ar|    PN term. \I*=aʔ-\i (or \I*=āʔ-;\i the vowel length is unclear because of loss of the laryngeal in Chech.), dur. \I*=ēʔ-\i (Chech. \I-eʔ-,\i Bacb. \I-eʔ-\i).
23|*=aŁ-|24|to die|=al-|=al-|=al-ar|    *-Ł- reconstructed on basis of Bacb. Mats. \I=aλ-,\i Kad. \I=al-.\i The present/ future form is PN \I*la\i (Chech.,Ing.,Bacb. \Ila\i).
24|*ǯʡali(j)|424|dog|žʕäla|žʕali||    Possibly a loan from Kartvelian, cf. PK *ʒ̥1̇aɣl- "dog" (ESKY 236).
25|*pħu|26|1 dog 2 male dog|pħu 2|pħu 2|pħu 1|    Obl. base \I*pħare-\i (Chech. \Ipħära-,\i Ing. \Ipħaro,\i Bacb. pl. \Ipħar-č\i). 3d class in Chech. and Bacb., 6th class in Ing.
26|*maλ-|402|drink|mala|mala|maλar|    PN term. *maλ-, dur. *mēλ-/*mē-b-λ- (>Chech. mīl-, Ing. mel-, Bacb. meλ-). The *m- is probably a historical prefix.
27|*=aq̇-|29|dry|=eq̇a|=eq̇a|=aq̇ĩ|    PN \I*=aq̇-i(n)\i "dry" is derived from the verbal base \I*=aq̇-\i "to dry, to get dry" (cf. Chech. \I=aq̇-ō\i tr., \I=aq̇a-dala\i intr., Bacb. \I=aq̇-dar\i tr.).
28|*la|425|ear|lerg|lerg|larḳ|    The early PN paradigm must be reconstructed as \I*la,\i \I*lari-.\i The first form is preserved in Chech. \Ila-dīʁa/-dōʁa,\i Ing. \Ila-duwʁa\i "to listen". The second form gave rise to the diminutive \I*lari-ḳ\i which has survived as the basic word for "ear" (cf. also Cheb. \Ilarig,\i Shar. \Ilerig\i etc.). This form belongs to the 3d class in Chech., Ing. and to the 8th class in Bacb.
29|*lātte|426|1 earth 2 rubbish, litter|latta 1|lätta 1|latt 2|    3d class in all languages.
30|*jobsṭ ( ~ -ō-)|427|1 earth 2 loose earth||jost 2|jobsṭ 1|    PN \I*jobsṭ,\i \I*ʔabsṭV-r-\i (cf. Ing. \Iastaro\i). 4th class in Ing., 3d class in Bacb. Without Chech. parallels the vowel length is not clear.
31|*=aq̇-|277|to eat|=aʔ-|=aʔ-|=aq̇-|    One of the cases of irregular development *-q̇- > -ʔ- in Chech.-Ing. Also means "gnaw" in Chech.
32|*ʔo|2303|that|||o|    Isolated within Nakh, but obviously an archaic pronoun stem.
33|*foʔ|428|1 grain 2 egg 3 grain forage|hoʔa 2, hoʔ 3|fuʔ 1,3|oʔ 1|    The two words in Chech. are hard to separate, although words meaning "egg" belong to the 3d class, and words meaning "grain" - to the 6th class in Chech. and Ing. (in Ing. \Ifuʔ\i "grain forage" vacillates between 5th and 6th classes, and in Bacb. \Ioʔ\i "grain" belongs to the 5th class). The original meaning is pro- bably "grain, grain forage" (cf. the external evidence) with a secondary de- velopment of meaning "grain > egg". The Chech. form \Ihoʔa\i is obviously a result of a secondary analogy with the obl. stem \Ihoʔa-\i (Ing. \Ifuʔo\i).    The vowel -u- (instead of -o-) in Ing. (cf. also Chech. Cheb. \Ihuʔa,\i Pharch. \Ihuʔ\i "egg") is due to the strong labializing influence of initial *f-.
34|*gagan|33|egg|||gagã|    Isolated in Bacb., but with rather reliable external parallels.
35|*bʡa|34|eye|bʕärg|bʕarg|bʕarḳ|    The PN paradigm was \I*bʡa,\i \I*bʡare-,\i with a diminutive form \I*bʡare-ḳ,\i which was preserved in all languages. The form \I*bʡa\i survives as \Ibʕa\i (somewhat archaic) in Chech. and Ing. The word vacillates between 5th and 6th classes in all languages (bj in Bacb.).
36|*moħ|130|fat (n.)|moħ|muħ||    Obl. base \I*maħar-,\i cf. Chech. \Imaħara-,\i Ing. \Imaħaro.\i 4th class in Chech., but 6th class in Ing. -u- in Ing. is due to labialization after m-.
37|*pēla-ḳ|430|feather|pēlag|||    Isolated in Chech., but with reliable external parallels.
38|*c̣e|38|fire|c̣e|c̣i|c̣e|    PN paradigm: \I*c̣e,\i \I*c̣ari-\i (Chech. \Ic̣era-,\i Ing. \Ic̣ero,\i Bacb. \Ic̣ari-\i); 4th class.
39|*č̣ʕāre|431|fish|č̣āra|č̣q̇ära|č̣arĕ|    6th class in all languages. Cf. also Shar. \Ič̣q̇ēri,\i It. \Ič̣q̇ēra.\i
40|*-ēŁ-|135|walk, roam; fly|lēl-|lel-|lel-|    Initial *l- in most forms is either a prefix or the result of an old reduplication (without it cf. Bacb. imper. \I-ol\i "come (here)!"). Cf. also \I*-ē-b-Ł-\i in Chech. \I-īl-\i "to walk across, walk out". Since Chech. and Ing. have preserved only the durative stem, it is hard to establish vowel  length in the PN terminative form \I*l-aŁ-\i ( > Bacb. \Ilal-\i). The affricate *-Ł- is reconstructed on basis of Bacb. (Matsiyev) \Ileλ-,\i (Kadagidze) \Ilel-.\i
41|*kōḳ|267|foot, leg|kog|kog|koḳ|    Obl. base \I*kōḳa-\i (Chech. \Ikōga-,\i Ing. \Ikoga-\i). 6th class in all languages.
42|*=uc̣-i(na)|44|full|=üz-na|=iza|=uc̣-inŏ|    A participle form from PN \I*=uc̣-\i "to be filled, satiated" (Chech. \I=uz-,\i Bacb. \I=uc̣-\i). It is rather probable, that PN \I*=ac̣-i(n)\i 'heavy' (Chech., Ing. \I=eza,\i Bacb. \I=ac̣ĩ,\i Cheb. \I=azĩ,\i Khild. \I=eʒĭ\i etc; the pure root is preserved in Chech. \I=az-dan\i "make expensive", Bacb. \I=ac̣-dar\i "make heavy") is an Ablaut variant of the same stem.
43|*=aλ-|45|give|=al-|=al-|=aλ-|    Pres./fut. \I*lo\i (Chech., Bacb. \Ilo,\i Ing. \Ilu\i). Cf. also the Ablaut stem (with a preverb) \I*t-ēλ-\i in Chech. \Itēl-\i 'to pay', Bacb. \Iteλ-\i 'to give'.
44|*dik-/*dak-|432|good|dika|dika|dakĩ|    Vocalism unclear: \I*dik-i(n)\i in Chech., Ing. (cf. also Chech. Usl. \Idikiŋ\i), but \I*dak-i(n)\i in Bacb.
45|*būc|433|grass|buc|buc|buc|    Obl. base \I*bāci-\i (Chech. \Ibēca-,\i Ing. \Ibäco\i). 4th class in all languages. Cf. also Chech. \Ibäccara\i (Usl. \Ibēcciriŋ\i), Ing. \Ibäccara\i 'green' ( < \I*bācci-ri(n\i) with expressive gemination).
46|*ʔap- ?|434|green|||apẽ|    Isolated in Bacb. with no obvious etymology.
47|*čo|340|hair|čo|čo|čo|    6th class in all languages.
48|*ko|268|hand|küg|kulg|ko|    The PN paradigm should be probably reconstructed as \I*ko\i (Bacb. \Iko,\i Chech., Ing. \Ika\i with vowel levelling - but cf. also Ing. \Iko\i 'handle', perhaps preserving the old direct stem), \I*kar-\i (cf. Chech. \Ikara,\i Ing. \Ikara\i "into one's hands", Bacb. obl. base with vowel levelling \Ikor-\i). The stem \Ika\i is now preserved in Chech.-Ing. only in compounds, being replaced by a former diminutive \I*ku-leḳ\i (Ing. \Ikulg\i) / \I*ku-ʔiḳ\i (Chech. \Iküg,\i \Ikǖga-\i). 3d class in Chech., Ing.     Nakh *kuʔiḳ > Osset. \Iḳūx\i / \Iḳox\i 'hand', see Abayev 1958, 644.
49|*kōrta|256|head|korta|korta|kortŏ|    Obl. base \I*kōrti-\i (Chech. \Ikörta-,\i Ing. \Ikerto\i). 6th class in all languages.
50|*ꭓac̣-|435|hear|ꭓaza|ꭓaza|ꭓac̣ar|
51|*doḳ|55|heart|dog|dog|doḳ|    Obl. base \I*daḳi-\i (Chech. \Idega-,\i Usl. \Idegi-,\i Ing. \Idego\i). 3d class in all languages.
52|*kur|436|1 horn 2 arc|kur 1|kur 2||    Obl. base \I*kure-\i (Chech. \Iküra-,\i Ing. \Ikuro\i). The word means specifically "horn of wild animals" (as opposed to \Imaʕa\i) in Chech. 6th class in Chech., 5th class in Ing.
53|*mɦaʔo|205|horn|maʕa|muʕa|mʕaʔŏ|    Chech. -ʕ- instead of -ʔ- under influence of the original *-ɦ- in the initial cluster. Cf. also Shar., Khild. \Imʕaʔa.\i 4th class in all languages.
54|*sō|2283|I|so|so|so|    The PN paradigm is \I*sō\i (nom.), \I*sa-\i (gen., cf. Chech. \Isa-n,\i Bacb. \Isa-jĩ\i), \I*ʔas\i (erg., cf. Chech. \Ias,\i Ing. \Iaz\i). The length in \I*sō\i is regularly shortened, but has been preserved in derivate forms like \I*sō-nu\i (dat.) > Chech. \Isū-na.\i
55|*-ɦēw-|437|kill|-ē-|-e|-ʕev-|    PN term. *-ɦēw-, dur. *ɦāw- (preserved only in Bacb. ʕav-).
56|*gagu (~-ā-)|438|knee|gōla|go|gawgŭ|    The Chech. form goes back to \I*gagu-la\i ( = Ing. \Igola\i "elbow; curve") and means also "elbow, curve".
57|*ꭓ-aʔ-|408|know|ꭓaʔa|ꭓa|ꭓeʔar|    PN term. \I*ꭓaʔ-,\i dur. \I*ꭓēʔ-\i (Bacb. \Iꭓeʔ-\i). The *ꭓ- is an historical preverb.
58|*=abc̣-|160|1 to know 2 to get to know|=ovz- 2|=ovz- 2|=abc̣- 1, 2|
59|*ʁa|439|leaf|ʁa|ʁa||    3d class in Chech., Ing. Obl. base \I*ʁa-na-\i (Chech. \Iʁana-,\i Ing. \Iʁano\i).
60|*=ill-|133|1 to lie 2 to put|ʕ-ill- 1,=ill 2|all- 1, =ill- 2|=ill- 2|    A very productive PN root with rich Ablaut. It forms two vowel grade pairs:     1) PN term. \I*-ill-\i (also with a *ʕ- preverb) > Chech. \Iʕill-\i "lie", \I-ill-\i "put upon (smth.)", Ing. \I-ill-\i "put", Bacb. \I-ill-\i id. / dur. \I*-ē-b-l\i > Bacb. \I-ebl-\i "put upon, inside". The root is also used with a t- prefix ( \I*t-ill-\i 'to put (from above)' > Chech., Ing., Bacb. \Itill-,\i dur. \I*t-ēbl-\i > Bacb. \Itebl-.\i     2) PN intr. \I*-āll-\i > Chech. \I-all-\i (\I-äll-ira\i) "be (put) inside", Ing. \I-all-\i (\I-oall-\i) "to be inside", \Iall-\i "lie" / tr. \I*-ōll-\i > Chech., Ing., Bacb. \I-oll-\i "to put inside, put in".     There are also some common Nakh forms with a single *-l- (geminated *-ll- in the forms listed above is either expressive, or reflects old suffixation). Besides \I*-ēbl-\i 'to put upon, inside' cf. also PN \I*=ōl-\i / \I*=ēbl-\i 'to begin' (Chech. \I=ōl-,\i Ing. \I=ol-,\i Bacb. \I=ol-\i / \I=ebl-\i), \I=āl-\i / \I*=ēbl-\i 'to finish' (Chech. \I=āl-/=īl-/=owl-,\i Ing. \I=al-\i). The semantic change 'to put > to begin/finish' ('*to put a beginning/end') is widely spread in Caucasian languages.     An old nominal derivate is PN \I*lol\i ( < \I*r-ol\i = PC \I*rɨLə,\i PA \I*riƛV-\i) "leathern loop on belt for hanging up the dagger" (= "receptacle, place to put smth. in"), reflected in Chech. \Ilol\i (\Ilala-ra-\i), Ing. \Ilol\i (\Ilala-ro\i).     [The productiveness of this root in PN may be explained by the fact that it probably reflects a merger of two EC roots: \I*-ä̆ƛĔw\i and \I*-iŁV\i 'to put'.]
61|*-iš-|440|1 lie  2 go to bed, go to sleep|-īš- 2||-iš- 1|    The Chech. form goes back to the PN Ablaut grade *-e-b-š-.
62|*daHVꭓ|441|liver|doʕaꭓ|dĳꭓk|dʕeʔ|    The PN reconstruction presents some difficulties. Chech. points to *-u- in the 2d syllable (\Idoʕaꭓ\i < \I*daHuꭓ\i), Ing. - to *-i- (\Idīꭓk\i < \I*daHiꭓ-iḳ\i with a diminutive suffix) and Bacb. - to *-e-. Final -ʔ in Bacb. is probably a re- sult of assimilation (spirant -ꭓ > laryngeal); anyway, it is impossible to separate the Bacb. form from Chech. and Ing. The word belongs to the 3d class in all languages.
63|*=ʕāꭓ-(in)|66|long|=ēꭓ-a|=ʕäꭓ-a|=aꭓꭓ-ẽ|    Cf. also Shar. \I=ʕēꭓĩ,\i Cheb. \I=āꭓẽ,\i Khild. \I=ʕēꭓe\i etc. The geminated -ꭓꭓ- in Bacb. is obviously expressive. The pure root \I*ʕāꭓ-\i is present in Chech. \I=aꭓ-dan\i "to lengthen", Bacb. \I=aꭓ-dar\i id.
64|*mac̣e|67|louse|meza|maza|mac̣|    6th class in all languages.. Cf. also Cheb. \Imaze,\i Khild. \Imeʒe\i etc.
65|*borš|328|1 bull-calf  2 male|borš 1, börša 2|borša 1,2|borš 1|    PN \I*borš,\i obl. \I*barša-\i (cf. Chech. \Ibarša-n;\i short vowel reconstructed on basis of Chech. plur. \Iberšaloj\i). Chech. \Ibörša,\i Ing. \Iborša\i go back to a suffixed form \I*borš-e(n).\i The noun belongs to the 4th class in Chech., Ing., but to the 5th in Bacb.
66|*maʡa ?|442|man, male||maʕa||    Isolated in Ing., with no obvious parallels.
67|*psṭu|124|bull|stu|ust|psṭu|    Ing. has a secondary prothesis (\Iust\i < \I*u-sṭu\i). Obl. base \I*psṭare-\i (cf. Chech. \Istera-,\i Ing. \Iistar-o,\i Bacb. \Ipsṭari-\i). 6th class in all languages. The same historical root (with loss of *p-) is present in the compound \I*sṭ-aḳ\i "man, person" q.v.
101|*sṭ-aḳ|370|person, man|stag|sag|sṭaḳ|    Obl. base \I*sṭaḳe-,\i cf. Chech. \Istega-,\i Ing. \Isago,\i Bacb. \Isṭaḳi-.\i Historically a compound (for the first part cf. PN \I*psṭu\i "bull").
68|*duqa|443|many|duqa|duqa|duq|
69|*ǯiǯ-iḳ|444|meat|žižig|||    An isolated Chech. word, but with some external parallels.
70|*dilꭓu|69|1 meat 2 fleshy part of body|dilꭓa 2|dulꭓ 1|ditꭓĭ 1|    3d class in all languages.
71|*butt|70|moon, month|butt|butt|butt|    Obl. base \I*batti-\i (Chech. \Ibetta-,\i Ing. \Ibetto\i). 6th class in all languages.
72|*lām|295|mountain|lam|lɔm|lam|    Obl. base \I*lāmu-\i (cf. Ing. \Ilɔmo,\i whence with vowel levelling the direct base \Ilɔm;\i in Chech. the old obl. stem is preserved in /Uslar/ \Ilɔ̄mu\i "up the mountain", being replaced by the more common levelled obl. base \Ilāma-na-\i). 6th class in all languages.
73|*baḳa|445|mouth|baga|bage|baḳ|    Ing. \Ibage\i reflects a suffixed form. 4th class in Chech., Ing., bj in Bacb.
74|*c̣e|72|name|c̣e|c̣i|c̣e|    Obl. base \I*c̣ari-\i (Chech. \Ic̣era-,\i Ing. \Ic̣ero,\i Bacb. \Ic̣ari-\i). 4th class in all languages.
75|*c̣in-|73|new|c̣ina|c̣ena|c̣inĭ|    For the pure stem cf. Chech. \Ic̣in-dan\i "to renew". The full form in PN shows vacillation between \I*c̣in-a(n)\i (Ing. \Ic̣ena\i) and \I*c̣in-e(n)\i (Bacb. \Ic̣inĭ\i); Chech. \Ic̣ina\i may go back to either.
76|*bus-|446|night|büjsa|bĳsa|bujsa|    The original root is well preserved in PN \I*bus-u\i "at night" (Chech. \Ibusa,\i Ing. \Ibus,\i Bacb. \Ibujs\i). The noun "night" is a derivate \I*busu-ja\i ( > \I*bujsa\i).
77|*marλo|52|nose|mara|meraž|marλŏ|    Obl. base \I*marλi-\i (cf. Chech. \Imera-,\i Ing. \Imera-ž\i - originally a suffixed form; cf. also Bacb. \Imajrλa\i < \I*marλi-ja\i "face"). 6th class in chech, Bacb., but 4th class in Ing. Cf. also Shar., Itumk. \Imarhŏ\i "nose".
78|*ca|2273|not (negative particle)|ca|ca|ca|Cf. also Chech. -za 'negative participle'.
79|*cħa|2314|one|cħaʔ|caʕ|cħa|    The final glottal stop is probably secondary (like in other numerals), but it led to an assimilatory development \I*cħaʔ\i > \Icaʕ\i in Ing. (cf.  without it forms like \Icħä\i "single", \Icħa-nne\i /obl. base of \Icaʕ/\i etc.).
80|*daʁu|77|rain|doʁa|doʁa||    3d class in Chech. and Ing. Note that the verbal present stem \I*-āʁ-\i ( > Chech. \I-ōʁu\i) "to come" has also the meaning "to rain, to snow"; thus the form \I*daʁu\i may have been deverbal in PN.
81|*q̇ar ?|447|rain|||q̇ar|    An isolated Bacb. root with obscure etymology.
82|*nīq̇|80|road|neq̇|niq̇|niq̇|    Obl. base \I*nāq̇i-\i (Chech. \Inēq̇a-,\i whence with vowel levelling the direct base \Ineq̇;\i Ing. \Inäq̇o,\i Bacb. \Inaq̇i-\i). 6th class in Chech., Ing., bd in Bacb.
83|*ārum ?|448|root|ōram|||    An isolated Chech. word of obscure origin.
84|*ʔablV (̃-λ-,-Ł-)|82|1 root 2 village|evla 2|ovla 1||    Vowel differences in Chech. and Ing. can be explained by different analogical levellings of a paradigm like \I*ʔabla,\i \I*ʔabli-.\i The semantic difference can be explained if we look at external evidence (this root reveals meanings like "root" and "kin, family > village" in many languages). Thus the resemb- lance of the Chech. word to Turkish (e.g. Tat. \Iaul\i "village" etc.) is probably accidental (at the most the Turk. word could have influenced the meaning of the Chech. word - but there are not enough reasons to speak of a loan).
85|*gōga|84|circle|gō|gō|gogŏ|    6th class in all languages. A wide-spread derivative is PN \I*gōg-rV-\i "round" : Chech. \Igorga,\i Usl. \Igorga-ŋ\i (\I*gōg-ra-n\i), Ing. \Igerga,\i Bacb. \Igogrĩ\i (\I*gōg-ri-n\i).
86|*lē-w- / *ʔāλ-|449|to say|lē-, āl-|le-, al-|lev-, aλ-|    The PN paradigm is \I*ʔāλ-\i (term.) vs. \I*lē-w-\i (with loss of initial vowel) (dur.). In Bacb. there also exists a secondary Ablaut stem \Ilaw-\i "to talk to someone".
87|*gu- / *=ag-|86|see|g-|g-|gu-,=ag-|    The PN paradigm (term. \I*=ag-,\i dur. \I*gu-\i) has been preserved in Bacb.; Chech. and Ing. lost the terminative stem (because of the development *-g- > -0-).
88|*ʡa-/*ʡē-|194|1 sit 2 stay 3 be in a quiet state|ʕ-/ʕē- 1,3|ʕe- 2|ʕe-/ʕa- 1|    PN dur. \I*ʕa-,\i term. \I*ʕē-;\i in Bacb. the stem is preserved only in the compound \Iʕe-aʁ-\i / \Iʕa-aʁ-\i "sit".
89|*č̣iw ( / *č̣uj)|1528|1 ramrod 2 knitting needle 3 shuttle, spool|č̣ū 1,3|č̣ĳ 1,3|č̣uj 2|    6th class in all languages. The meaning 'sharp thing, sharp stick' is also present in anatomic compounds: Chech. \Ič̣ū-nosta\i 'tibial bone, fibula', Ing. \Ič̣ĳ-nosta\i id., Chech. \Ič̣ū-pħars\i 'funny-bone, ulna'. The PN form was borrowed in Cham. \Ič̣iwa\i (Gig. \Ič̣iwa\i) 'sabre'.
90|*c̣ōka|451|skin|c̣ōka|c̣oka||    4th class in Chech.; 3d or 4th class in Ing. (3d class - generally, 4th class - "skin of a wolf, dog, hare etc."). Cf. also Pharch. \Ic̣ōka,\i Lev. \Ic̣wōka.\i

93|*tōħ-|453|sleep|tħ-|tħ-|toħ-|    The Bacb. stem is probably corresponding to tħ- in Chech. tħ-ows-, Ing. tħ-ajs-  'fall asleep' q.v.
94|*fuw|251|seed|hu|fu|huv|    Obl. base \I*fune-\i (Chech. \Ihüna-,\i Ing. \Ifuno\i). 3d class in all languages.
95|*ǯʕVm-|454|small|žima|zʕam-iga|žomẽ|    The root reveals some irregularities (due to its expressive nature): unclear is the vocalism and the correlation between hushing and whistling consonants.
96|*ʔi|2309|demonstrative pronoun|i(-za)|i-z|e, i|    The stem \I*ʔi\i (with vacillation between i and e in Bacb.) is the normal pronoun for near deixis in Bacb.; in Chech./Ing. it designates the second degree of nearness and is also the standard 3d person pronoun.
97|*ḳur|455|smoke|ḳur|ḳur|ḳur|    Obl. base \I*ḳure-,\i cf. Chech. \Iḳüra-,\i Ing. \Iḳuro,\i Bacb. \Iḳuri-.\i 5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. and Bacb.
98|*-ātt-|95|stand|latt-|latt-|latt-|    For long *-ā- cf. Chech. pres. \Ilätta,\i Ing. pret. \Ilättad.\i The root reveals a complicated Ablaut pattern:     a) PN \I*-itt-\i > Chech. \Ih-itt-\i to stand upon , \Iʁ-itt-\i to stand up (dur.);     b) PN \I*-ott-\i > Chech. \Ih-ott-\i to stand upon, \Iʁ-ott-\i to stand up (term.), Ing. \Iott-\i to become, Bacb. \Iott-\i to stand up, stop;      c) PN \I*-ātt-\i > Chech., Ing., Bacb. \Ilatt-\i to stand.
99|*sēṭHo|456|star|sēda|sedq̇a||    6th class in Chech. and Ing. Cf. also Cheb. sjēdo, Shar. sjēṭo, Khild. sjōdo etc.
100|*ṭɦari (~-ā-,-ē-,-e)|357|star|||ṭʕejrĭ|    The root is preserved only in Bacbi, but is no doubt archaic.

106|*muʁ (~-ū-)|333|1 tail 2 part of harness (put under the tail)|mulʁa 2|mulʁa 2|muʁ 1|    The simple root has been preserved only in Bacb. (4th class); Chech. and Ing. forms reflect the PN derivate \I*muʁ-lV\i ( = Bacb. \Imujʁlĭ\i).
107|*da-|2304|demonstrative pronoun stem|dʕā|dʕa|da-ħ|    The actual stem \Ida-\i is clearly seen in Bacb. \Ida-ꭓeʔ\i "because of that", \Ida-ħ,\i \Ida-ħa\i "there". The Chech.-Ing. form \Idʕā\i is a contraction from \I*da-ħa;\i it served as a basis for the now common demonstrative pronoun \Idʕā-ra\i "that".
108|*ha|2313|demonstrative pronoun|ha-ra|ja, je-r|e-h, o-h|    In Ing. there has probably occurred a contamination of \I*ha\i and \I*ʔi\i (q.v.), and thus appeared the form \Ija.\i The root is used for near deixis ('this'); in Bacbi it is combined with other deictic stems: \Ie-,\i \Io-.\i
109|*ħō|2286|thou (2d p.pr.)|ħo|ħo|ħo|    PN paradigm: nom. \I*ħō\i (shortened already in PN; length is preserved in forms like Chech. dat. \Iħū-na\i < \I*ħō-nu\i), obl. \I*ħa-\i (Chech., Ing., Bacb. \Iħa-\i), erg. \I*ʔaħ\i (Chech. \Iaħ,\i Ing. \Iʕa\i < \I*aʕ\i with secondary voicing, Bacb. aħ).
110|*moṭṭ|102|tongue|mott|mott|moṭṭ|    Obl. base \I*maṭṭi-\i (cf. Chech. \Imetta-,\i Ing. \Imetto\i). 6th class in all languages.
111|*ca|104|tooth|cerg|carg|carḳ|    The simple form \I*ca\i is preserved in Ing. \Ica\i "tooth" (besides the more common \Icerg\i) and Chech. \Ice\i "horse's tooth" (vocalism levelled by analogy with the obl. base \Icena-\i). More widely spread is the original diminutive \I*car-iḳ\i (4th class in all languages). Cf. also Cheb. \Icarig,\i Shar. \Icerig\i etc.
112|*ditt ( ~ -ī-,-ṭṭ)|460|1 mulberry tree 2 tree|ditt 1,2|ditt 2||    Obl. base \I*ditte-\i (~-ṭṭ-), cf. Chech. \Iditta-,\i Ing. \Iditto.\i 3d class in both languages.
113|*gag|461|1 branch 2 tree 3 bunch (of grapes)|ga 1|ga 1,2|gag 3|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing., 6th class in Bacb. Cf. also Akk. \Igav\i "branch".

115|*ši(n)|2316|two|šiʔ|šiʔ|ši|    The final glottal stop in Chech. and Ing. is secondary (as also in other numerals). The original base \Išin-\i is preserved as oblique (Chech., Ing. \Išina-\i).     Cf. also PN \I*šina-ra\i 'heifer (about 2 years old)' (Chech., Ing. šinara) which is, on one hand, an obvious derivate of \I*ši(n\i) 'two' (just like \I*qaʔar-ḳ\i 'a 3-years-old heifer' from the oblique base \I*qaʔa-\i 'three') and on the other hand - a perfect match for Lak., PL and PWC forms.
116|*=aꭓ-|108|walk, go|=aꭓ-|=aꭓ-|iꭓ-|    This stem reveals 3 Ablaut grades in PN: a) \I*ʔiꭓ-\i > Bacb. \Iiꭓ-\i walk; flow; b) \I*ʔeꭓ-\i > Chech. \Iʔeꭓ-\i id.; c) \I*=aꭓ-\i > Chech. \I=aꭓ-,\i Ing. \I=aꭓ-\i id., Bacb. \I=aꭓ-\i go away.
117|*mɦal-i(n)|111|warm; weak, loose|mela|mela|malĩ|    The laryngeal in the initial cluster is preserved only in the Shar. dialect (\Imʕalĩ\i); cf. also Cheb. \Imalĩ,\i Khild. \Imelĭ,\i Ved. \Imene,\i Kharach. \Imene\i etc. The pure base is seen in Chech. \Imal-dan\i "to weaken, loosen".
118|*ꭓi|112|water|ꭓi|ꭓĳ|ꭓi|    Cf. Chech. dat. \Iꭓi-na.\i 3d class in all languages.
119|*ꭓa|2294|an interrogative stem|(mū-)ꭓa||(wu-)ꭓ|    In Nakh this stem is used only as the second part of interrogative compounds (Chech. \Imū-ꭓa\i "which", Bacb. \Iwu-ꭓ\i "what").
120|*tꭓō|2288|we (excl.)|tꭓo|tꭓo|tꭓo|    PN paradigm: nom. \I*tꭓō\i (length preserved in forms like dat. \I*tꭓō-nu\i > Chech. \Itꭓū-na\i), obl. \I*tꭓa-\i (gen. Chech. \Itꭓa-n,\i Bacb. \Itꭓa-jĩ\i etc.), erg. \I*ʔāꭓu\i (Chech. \Iōꭓa,\i Ing. \Ioaꭓa,\i Bacb. \Iatꭓŏ\i - probably with secondary -tꭓ-).
121|*waj|2285|we (incl.)|vaj|vaj|vaj|
122|*fu-(n)|464|what (interrogative pronoun)|hun|fu|wu-ꭓ|    Cf. also Bacb. wũ "why", wu-naꭓ "something". A derived noun is PN *fu-ma 'thing' (Chech. huma, Ing. hama, Bacb. wum).
123|*ḳVj-|465|white|ḳajn|ḳaj|ḳujĩ|    Vocalism not clear (old Ablaut?) The pure stem is represented in Chech. \Iḳaj\i "wall-eye", Bacb. \Iḳuj-dar/ḳuv-dar\i "to whiten".
124|*mV|2301|interrogative stem|mila|mala|mẽ|    Widely used in PN, cf. Chech. \Imi-la\i who, \Imü-lꭓa\i which, \Imi-ča\i where, \Ima-ca\i when etc.; Ing. \Ima-la\i who, \Imi-ča\i where, \Ima-ca\i when etc.; Bacb. \Imẽ\i who, \Ime-lꭓu\i which, \Imič(a\i) where, \Imacã\i when etc.
125|*ʒɦuṭ|466|1 bitch  2 woman|zud 1, zuda 2|zud 1||    PN \I*ʒɦuṭ,\i \I*ʒɦuṭe-\i (3d class) "bitch" (for the obl. base cf. Chech. \Izüda-,\i Ing. \Izudo;\i cf. also Pharch., Akk. \Izud,\i Lev. \Iʒʕud\i id.). The derivate \I*ʒʕuṭan\i "woman" exists only in Chech. (cf. Usl. \Izudaŋ,\i Akk. \Izudã;\i note that the Lev. dialect in Imnaishvili's notation has no laryngeal here: \Iʒuda\i - perhaps a faulty transcription?).
126|*qadela ~ *qadale|467|mare|qēla|qal|qadal|    4th class in Chech. and Ing., bd in Bacb. The Ing. word for "woman" (qal-sag) is formed from this root.
127|*psṭuw|468|1 wife 2 princess|stū 2|suw 2|psṭu 1|    Obl. base \I*psṭuw-nV-,\i cf. Chech. \Istūna-,\i Ing. \Isuwno,\i Bacb. \Ipstujnĩ;\i cf. also Bacb. \Ipsṭujnŏ\i "woman". An interesting compound is Chech. \Istun-da\i "father-in-law" ("wife's father") = Ing. \Iust-da,\i where Ing. has a prothetic vowel and preserves the -st- combination. Cf. also Cheb. \Istu,\i Shar., Khild. \Isu.\i

131|*sēn-i(n)|626|blue|sīna|sīna|sejnĭ, sīnĭ|    Cf. also Cheb. \Isjēni\i 'blue'. The pure root is preserved in Chech. \Isen-dan\i 'to make blue', Bacb. \Isen-dalar\i 'to become blue'.

134|*=ācu-n|380|short|=ōca|lɔca|=acũ|    Ing. has a prefixed l-; cf. also Cheb. \I=ācũ,\i Shar. \I=ōcũ\i etc. For the pure root cf. Chech. \I=ac-dan,\i Bacb. \I=ac-d-ar\i "to shorten".
135|*laħi|145|snake|läħa|leħa|laħ|    6th class in all languages.
136|*-uṭq̇-i(n)|472|thin|-uṭq̇a|-iṭq̇a|d-uṭq̇ĩ|    The Chech. form goes back to *-uṭq̇-a(n) (but cf. dialectal forms: Cheb. -uṭq̇ĩ, Shar. -ujṭq̇ĩ, Akk. -üṭq̇a etc. which are regular). Cf. also Bacb. -uṭq̇-dar "make thin".
137|*m(ɦ)oꭓ|94|wind|moꭓ|muꭓ|moꭓ|    6th class in all languages. Obl. base \I*maꭓi-\i (Chech. \Imeꭓa-,\i Ing. \Imiꭓo,\i Bacb. \Imaꭓi-\i).

139|*qōṗe|474|1 trichina 2 worm|qȫba 1|qop 1|qawṗŭ 2|    4th class in all languages. The Bacb. form probably reflects a former obl. stem \I*qāṗu-\i (which was lost in Chech. and Ing.).

144|*=uꭓ|484|bottom, lower part|=uꭓ|=uꭓ|=uꭓ|    Obl. base \I*=uꭓe\i (Chech. \I=üꭓa-,\i Ing. \I=uꭓo\i). The root is used only with class prefixes.
145|*č̣alḳo|485|hoof|||č̣alḳŏ|    Isolated in Bacb., but with rather probable Andian parallels.
146|*kān|490|wool (shorn in spring)|kan|ka||    Obl. base \I*kāne-\i (Chech. \Ikēna-,\i Ing. \Ikano\i). 3d class in both languages.
147|*kur|338|tuft of hair, forelock|kur|||    Obl. base \Iküra-.\i The word is isolated in Chech., but has reliable external parallels.
148|*bʕēꭓul-|343|snake|bȫꭓal-la|bʕeꭓal||    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing.
149|*ʁaṭ|495|stem, stalk|ʁad|ʁad||    Obl. base \I*ʁaṭ[u]-\i (cf. Chech. \Iʁoda-,\i Ing. \Iʁado-\i); 3d class in both languages. Cf. also PN \I*ʁaṭ[u]-m\i > Chech. \Iʁodam\i 'maize stalk', Ing. \Iʁadam\i 'stalk'.
150|*dos|496|1 wood, firewood  2 place for chopping wood|dos-buꭓ 2|dos 1|dos 1|    Obl. base \I*dasi-\i (cf. Ing. \Ideso\i). 3d class in Ing. and Bacb.

152|*ḳiḳel|507|fruit|||ḳiḳel (Desh.)|    The Bacb. word is isolated within Nakh, but has rather reliable external parallels.
153|*ħān-i(n)|510|fat, greasy|ħēna|ħäna||    The pure stem is preserved in Chech. \Iħan-dan\i 'to fatten, fertilize'.

Differences in vocalism between Chech. and Ing. are explained by vowel levelling of direct/oblique bases. Length of the vowel in Bacbi (Kadagidze gives variants: \Idārc̣ol,\i \Idārc̣ola,\i \Idārc̣ina\i) is unclear (Bacbi does not normally distinguish between short and long vowels, and, anyway, in this case Chechen obviously points to a short vowel in PN). Cf. also dialectal forms with assimilation: Khild. \Iʒarʒ,\i Shar. \Iʒjerʒ,\i Akk. \Icjerc.\i Imnaishvili has a notation for Ing.: \Idjerc:\i - which points to PN *c̣. The word belongs to the 3d class both in Chech. and in Ing.

158|*psarV|530|1 evening 2 yesterday 3 in the evening|süjrē 1,sara-ħ3|sajra1,sara-ħa3|psara 1, psare2|    The Nakh forms reflect different locatives and derivates from the root \I*psar(V)-\i (not attested without suffixes). The root is also used in Bacb. \Isi-psre(ħ)\i 'the day before yesterday' = Chech. \Isīsara,\i Ing. \Isĳsara\i id. (etymology of the first part, PN \I*si-,\i is not quite clear - perhaps a dissimilation < \I*ši-\i 'two', lit. 'two evenings (ago)').
159|*ḳurḳḳ- ( ~ -ū-)|540|whirlpool|ḳurḳ-mani|||    Obviously an expressive word, but with some possible external parallels.
160|*=ʕābꭓ-V(n)|334|hot|=owꭓa|=ʕajꭓa|=apꭓẽ|    This adjective is a derivate from a verbal root \I*=ʕōbꭓ-/*=ʕēbꭓ-,\i reflected in Bacb. \I=epꭓ-dar\i 'to warm up' (dur.), \I=opꭓ-dar\i id.

161|*ʡo-|561|go|||ʕo- (pres.)|    An isolated Bacb. root (used only in the present tense), but probably archaic.
162|*-iʔ-|162|to be in time, to have time|q-iʔ-|q-e-||    The root also means 'to ripen, grow up' which reflects a contamination  with another PEC root \I*ʔirq̇ʷV\i q.v.

167|*=ač̣- (~ -ā-)|945|to gnaw|||=ač̣-|    Isolated in Bacb., but having good external parallels.
168|*ṭā|576|1 front leg (of animal) 2 bottom chuck (of animal)|ṭa 1|ṭa 1|ṭa 1,2|    Obl. base \I*ṭā-ni-,\i cf. Chech. \Iṭǟna-,\i Ing. \Iṭäno.\i 3d class in all languages.
169|*mač̣|228|1 beard 2 moustache|maž 1|mož (moǯ) 1|mač̣ 2|    Obl. stem \I*mač̣u-,\i cf. Chech. \Imoža-\i (Usl. \Imažu-\i), Ing. \Imožo\i (hence, with vowel levelling, the direct base vocalism: \Imož\i). 4th class in all languages. Cf. also Chech. Lev., Pharch. \Imaž,\i Khild. \Imoǯ,\i Cheb. \Imač̣,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Imwoč:.\i
170|*ǯaq̇|8|a k. of small bird|maž-žaq̇|||    The 1st component of Chech. \Imažžaq̇\i "жулан" is \Imaž-\i 'yellow' q.v. The word is isolated in Nakh, but has good external parallels.
171|*čālu(n)|170|1 grey 2 roan|čōla 1|čɔla 2||    Cf. also Cheb. \Ičōlõ,\i Ved. \Ičālã\i etc. The word resembles Turk. \I*čāl\i 'grey', but cannot be a loanword (because of its morphological structure); however, the Turk. word could have influenced the meaning of Nakh \I*čālu(n\i) - since the original meaning of the root in Dagestan languages is 'blue, green'.
172|*ʁōr|21|1 cold (n.) 2 freeze|ʁōr-ō 2||ʁor 1|   4th class in Bacb. Cf. also Bacb. \Iʁor-ĩ\i 'cold as ice', \Iʁor-dar\i 'freeze'. Historically this is a verbal root with a suffixed -r. A trace of the vocalized stem \I*-aʁ-\i is probably present in the compound Chech. \Iʕin-daʁ,\i Ing. \Iʕin-darʁa\i 'shadow'.
173|*ṭʕām|592|wing|ṭam|ṭq̇am||    6th class in Chech. and Ing. Obl. stem \I*ṭʕāmu-\i (Chech. \Iṭōma-,\i Ing. - with vowel levelling - \Iṭq̇amo\i). Cf. also Shar. \Iṭʕām,\i Akk. \Iṭq̇am.\i
174|*ħēꭓ-|595|teach|ħēꭓ-|ħeꭓ-||
175|*č(ɦ)il (~ -ī-)|31|ashes, dust||čil||    Isolated in Ing., but with rather probable external parallels.
176|*ɦārcu|207|1 anxiety, alarm 2 help in danger 3 raid, foray|orca 1,2|ɔrc 2|ʕarcŏ 3|    3d class in all languages. Cf. also Cheb. \Iārcu,\i Ved. \Iōrcu\i etc.
177|*kaḳ-|143|small, minute|keg-ī (pl.)|kegĳ (pl.)|kaḳẽ|    The root is also present in Chech. \Ikag-dan/keg-dan\i 'break, destroy' ('make minute'), Ing. kag-de, Bacb. keḳ-dar id. Cf. also Chech. Cheb. \Ikagĩ\i 'small, minute', pl. \Ikagĳ.\i
178|*l-abc̣-|603|lean upon a staff while stepping|l-owz-|||    Isolated in Chech., but obviously archaic. Length of vowel is determined by forms like \Ilewz-ira,\i \Ilewz-ina.\i There exists also a durative stem \Ilīz-\i < \I*l-ēbc̣-.\i
179|*mVꭓV|607|1 asp 2 poplar, willow|maꭓ 1|miꭓa 2||    The Chech. word is quoted from the Russian-Chechen Dictionary. Vocalism is not quite clear. 4th class in Ing.
180|*=att-|611|to bake, roast|=att-|=att-|=att-|    Short vowel: cf. Chech. \I=ott-u,\i \I=ett-ira,\i Ing. \I=ott,\i \I=etta-.\i
181|*l(ɦ)ēq̇|587|quail|leq̇|leq̇||    Cf. Chech. obl. \Ilēq̇a-.\i 3d class in Chech., but 4th in Ing.
182|*mām-aḳ|15|female breast|māmag|||    An isolated Chech. word (with a diminutive suffix); although it is a "children's word", it has direct parallels in other EC languages.
183|*qēs|627|mane|qes|qes||    Cf. Chech. obl. stem \Iqēsara-;\i Lev. \Iqjes,\i Pharch. \Iqes.\i 4th class in Chech. and Ing.
184|*ʔoHV-la ( ~ -ō-)|630|thought|ojla|ujla||    Reconstruction of Inlaut uncertain because of the absence of Bacbi parallels (*-g- also possible). The word is an exact parallel to Av. \Iúrʁe-l\i 'thought'.
185|*m(ɦ)arʁV|643|1 shoot, offspring 2 twig, rod 3 a single straw|marʁa-l 1,2|merʁa 1,3||    3d class in Chech. and Ing.

187|*ʁorʁ|648|1 coarse sand 2 rough, coarse|ʁorʁ 1, ʁorʁa 2|ʁorʁa 2||    The Chech. and Ing. adjectives go back to PN \I*ʁorʁ-a(n\i).
188|*tāl|651|1 poplar 2 chock|tal 1|täl-g 2||    Obl. base \I*tālu-,\i cf. Chech. \Itōla-.\i The original meaning had been probably 'stick, tree' (in general), whence the Ing. diminutive \I*tāl-iḳ\i > \Itälg.\i 3d class in Chech. and Ing.
189|*l-ēlꭓ-|652|to jump|lelꭓ-||letꭓ-|    With Ablaut and reduplication cf. also \I*ꭓalꭓV-:\i Chech. \Iꭓalꭓa-dāla,\i Ing. \Iꭓalꭓa-dala\i 'to dance'.
190|*sṭē-n-|2298|what (interrogative pronoun)|stē(n)-|se|sṭen-|    The basic form is ergative: Chech. \Isten,\i Ing. \Ise,\i Bacb. \Isṭẽ\i (cf. also Cheb. \Istjē̃,\i Shar., Khild. \Isjẽ\i etc.). For the vowel length cf. also Chech. gen. \Istēna-n;\i \Isten-ga\i 'where' etc.
191|*mʕēlq̇u|654|lizard|mölq̇a|melʕa||    Cf. also Cheb. \Imjelq̇u,\i Shar. \Imjolq̇o,\i Khild. \Imjolq̇ŭ\i etc. 6th class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. The shift -lq̇- > -lʕ- in Ing. points to an original cluster: \I*mʕēlq̇u\i > \I*mēlʕu\i > \Imelʕa.\i
192|*ʔārc̣iw|658|eagle|ärzū|ärzi|arc̣iw|    Cf. also Lev. \Iārzu,\i It. \Iērʒa.\i 4th class in Chech., Ing., 3d class in Bacb.
193|*-law|35|a suffix denoting profession|-lo|-lo|-law|    Cf. derivates like Chech. \Iṭema-lō\i 'warrior', \Ibelꭓa-lō\i 'worker' (Ing. \Ibolꭓ-lo\i), Bacb. \Iḳomsomol-low\i 'member of Komsomol' etc. The morpheme originally meant simply "man" (cf. the analogous use of -vi in Lezg., -ž̌i in Tab. < \I*ćʷĳo\i "man" etc.).
194|*ħēꭓ|679|lime-tree, linden|ħeꭓ|ħeꭓ||    Obl. base \I*ħēꭓa-,\i cf. Chech. \Iħēꭓa-,\i Ing. \Iħeꭓo\i (but also \I*ħēꭓu-,\i which is reflected in Chech. \Iħȫꭓa-n\i 'made of lime-tree'). 3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
195|*l-āl- (~-λ-)|168|to melt (intr.)|lāl-|lal-||    The l- is an historical preverb.
196|*ʔas-ar|292|inspiration|asar|||    Isolated within Nakh, but with reliable external parallels.
197|*ʁunṭV- (~-o-,-d-)|689|bug|ʁundalʁi|||    The word is homonymous with \Iʁundalʁi\i 'black elder' (Ing. \Iʁuldam\i), but this is probably fortuitous, since it has probable external parallels (or else a development "bug" > "black elder" had taken place - since black elder berries look like small insects?).
198|*juq̇|691|waist; middle|juq̇|juq̇|juq̇|    Obl. base \I*juq̇a-\i (cf. Chech. \Ijuq̇a-,\i Ing. \Ijuq̇o;\i in Bacb. there is a separate noun \Ijuq̇a\i 'middle, center', differentiated from \Ijuq̇\i 'waist'). 4th class in all languages.
199|*ʔaq̇Vr-|692|on one's back|arq̇a-l|arq̇a-l|aq̇rĕ|    A locative form from an archaic noun.
200|*m-arc-|694|to singe|marc-|marc-|marc-|    For vowel length cf. Chech. \Imerc-ira,\i Ing. \Imerc-ad\i etc.; cf. also Bacb. dur. \Imerc-ar\i ( < \I*mērc-\i with long vowel Ablaut grade).
201|*sa|700|soul|sa|sa|sa|    Obl. base \I*si-\i (Chech. \Isi-na-,\i Ing. \Isi-no,\i Bacb. pl. \Isĳ-š\i). 3d class in all languages.
202|*=ētt-|702|to milk|=ētt-|=ett-|=ett-|    Cf. also a derivate preserved in Bacb. and very archaic: \Ib-ettar\i (pl. \Id-ettri\i) 'a milch cow, sheep'. This root also influenced (semantically) PN \I*jētt\i 'cow' (q.v.) - which originally meant 'bull, ox'.
203|*laḳ|703|fruit stone|lag|||    Obl. base \I*laḳi-,\i cf. Chech. \Ilega-.\i Cf. also Lev. \Ilag,\i Cheb. \Ilaḳ.\i
204|*lar|229|track, footprint|lar|ler||    4th class in both languages. The root has a variation in the obl. stem: \I*laru-\i (Chech. \Ilora-\i) \I/*lari-\i (Ing. \Ilero,\i whence with vowel levelling the direct base \Iler\i).
205|*c̣ani(-n)|299|clean, pure|c̣ena|c̣ena|c̣ajn|
206|*pħō|719|sleeve|pħo-š|pħo-š|pħo|    Chech. and Ing. reflect a suffixed form \I*pħō-š\i (obl. base \I*pħōši-,\i cf. Chech. \Ipħǖša-\i); 3d class in Chech. and Ing., 6th class in Bacb. The Ablaut variant \I*pħā-\i is reflected in the compound \I*pħā-ʁat\i 'distance between stretched hands' (Chech. \Ipħā-ʁat,\i Ing. \Ipħa-ʁat\i), where \I*ʁat\i goes back to PEC \X<1>*q̲ĕmtV\x\i q.v.
207|*=is-|89|stay|=is-|=is-|=is-|
208|*ħun|282|forest|ħun|ħu|ħũ|    Obl. base \I*ħune-\i (cf. Chech. \Iħüna-,\i Ing. \Iħuno\i). 4th class in all languages.
209|*duq̇|737|mountain ridge|duq̇|||    Obl. base \Iduq̇a-.\i A homonym with \Iduq̇\i 'yoke' q.v., but most probably should be separated from it historically.
210|*bēr(λ)|738|ravine, gorge, hollow|bȫra|ber||   The PN paradigm should be probably reconstructed as \I*bēr(λ\i), \I*bēr(λ)u-\i; the Chech. direct base goes back to oblique. 6th class in Chech.
211|*čVꭓ-ar|748|rubble, quarry-stone|čꭓar|čꭓar||    The combination čꭓ- in Chech. and Ing. can only be explained as a result of vowel elision; unfortunately there is no Bacb. parallel, so the vowel quality is impossible to establish.
212|*marš (~-ā-)|751|hose; sausage|marš|||    Attested only in Chech., but having reliable external parallels.
213|*=it-|762|to leave|=it-|=it-|=it-|
214|*ħeṭṭ (~-ē-)|765|avalanche|ħätt||ħeṭṭ|    The Bacb. word is quoted from Мациев 1932 where it is spelled \Iħeṭ,\i pl. \Iħaṭṭ-iš.\i 4th class in both languages.
215|*=ōtt-/*=ētt-|767|to pour|=ott-|=ott-|=ott-|    \I*=ōtt-\i is terminative, \I*=ētt-\i - durative; in Bacb. there exists also a stem \I=att-\i ( < \I*=ātt-\i) 'to be poured (out)'.
216|*ʁānV|346|elm-tree||ʁän||    PN length can be established by the Ing. -ä- (which in this position can only go back to *ā).
217|*q-āč-|770|to arrive|qāč-|qač-|qač-|    q- is an old preverb.
218|*qin|115|1 wife of brother-in-law 2 daughter-in-law|qin 1|qɨ 2||    Obl. base \I*qina-\i (Chech. \Iqina-,\i Ing. \Iqɨno-\i).
219|*ʔibčV (~ɦ-)|463|1 corridor, gallery 2 veranda|ūčē 1|ujče 2||    Chech. -ē, Ing. -e is a suffix.
220|*kā|673|1 ram 2 male (of animals)|ka 1|ka 1|komõ 2|    Obl. base \I*kōme-\i (cf. Chech. \Ikȫma-,\i Ing. \Ikomo\i); the Bacb. adjective reflects directly this oblique base.
221|*ʡāꭓV-r|799|lamb|ʕāꭓar|ʕäꭓar|ʕaꭓr-ob|    PN -r is probably a former plural suffix (cf. the second plural affix added in the Bacb. form). 6th class in all languages.
222|*qāqu|800|ram (from 2 up to 3 years old)|qōqa|||    In Chech. cf. also the derivate \Iqēqorg\i 'lamb which has lost his mother'. The root is attested only in Chech., but has good EC parallels.
223|*ꭓabꭓV-r|802|a little lamb|ꭓowꭓar|ꭓowꭓar||    *-r is a former plural suffix.
224|*ta-bu|805|ram (1 year old or more)|tō|tɔ|tawbŭ|    -bu in PN is probably a former plural suffix.
225|*baq̇e|806|foal|beq̇a|baq̇|baq̇ŏ|    Cf. also Cheb. \Ibaq̇i,\i Shar., Ved. \Ibeq̇i\i etc. Obl. base with variations: \I*baq̇u-\i (Chech. \Iboq̇a-\i) / \I*baq̇i-\i (Ing. \Ibeq̇o\i). Nakh > Osset. \Ibäx\i 'horse' (see Abayev 1958, 255-256).
226|*boħ|807|kid|büħig|bʕĳg|boħ|    Chech. and Ing. reflect a diminutive form \I*boħ-iḳ\i (Ing. \Ibʕĳg\i is a contraction < \I*biħiḳ\i < \I*boħiḳ\i). Cf. also Shar. \Ibiħig,\i Khild., Itumk. \Ibʕĳg\i etc.
227|*bɦoḳ́|809|he-goat|bož|bož, boǯ|bʕoḳ|    Cf. also Shar., Khild. \Ibwog,\i Lev. \Ibwož.\i The old obl. stem must have been \I*bɦaḳ́i-\i (cf. Ing. \Ibežo\i); Chech. \Iboža-\i is a more recent analogical building.
228|*čuꭓV|812|lamb|čuꭓa||čujꭓĭ|    Final vowel not quite clear: Chech. points to \I*čuꭓa,\i while Bacb. - to \I*čuꭓe.\i
229|*psiḳ|820|flea|saga-l|saga-l|psiḳ|    The Chech.-Ing. form goes back to the PN obl. stem \I*psaḳa-\i with a suffixed -l.
230|*qo(w)e ~ *qe(w)u|822|haricot|qȫ|qe||    \I*qo(w)e\i or \I*qe(w)u\i are possible reconstructions, correlating with external evidence; without the Bacb. reflex it is impossible to make the reconstruction more precise.
231|*dāli|824|god|dēla|däla|dal, dalĕ|
232|*c̣ēbV|825|1 idol, god 2 heathen deity 3 priest|c̣ū 2|c̣uw 3|c̣ĳb 1|    The final vowel is not quite clear; however, Bacb. -ĳ- can only go back to *-ē-, thus the Inlaut vowel is clear.
233|*ʔant|827|shortcoming, defect|ant|||    Isolated in Nakh., but having an Av. parallel.
234|*ꭓattV (~ -ṭṭ-)|829|dirt, mire|ꭓatt|ꭓotta||    Obl. base \I*ꭓattu-\i (Chech. \Iꭓotta-\i); it is most probable that the Ing. direct base here reflects the original oblique one.
235|*ṭʡarš|830|slush, mire|ṭq̇arš|ṭarš||    There's not enough information to establish the PN vowel length in this root.
236|*b(ɦ)arš|831|1 watery clay mortar with sand 2 slush, puddle|borša-m|barš||    Chech. has a suffixed form (with a frequent nominal suffix *-(u)m). Vowel length, unfortunately, can not be established.
237|*huma (~f-)|835|sore, abscess, boil|huma|||    Attested only in Chech., but having good external parallels.
238|*ḳāṭi|836|1 birth-mark, mole 2 spot|ḳēda 1|ḳäd 2||    Initial *ḳɦ- also possible.
239|*qarta|837|rash, measles|qarta|qarta||    Vowel length can not be established.
240|*čint|838|wart|čint|||    Isolated in Chech. (thus PN *čɦ- or *čʕ- are also possible), but with some external parallels.
241|*ṭāṭi|839|freckle, spot|ṭēda|ṭäd||    *ṭɦ- also possible.
242|*maʁu|842|1 line 2 line, row|moʁa 2|muʁ 1||    Initial *mɦ- also possible. In Chech. the word has two obl. stems: \Imaʁara-\i 'row' (cf. Ing. \Imuʁaro\i) and \Imoʁana-\i 'line'; the latter is obviously secondary.
243|*maꭓu|845|stripe (on a cloth)|moꭓa|||    Isolated in Chech., but with probable external parallels. Initial *mɦ- also possible.
244|*mēʔ|848|young hen|meʔ|||    Chech. obl. \Imēʔa-.\i
245|*poppVr|850|1 clay 2 clay mortar|poppar 2|toppar 1||    Initial t- in Ing. is obviously a result of dissimilation. The root contains an expressive medial geminate. It belongs to the 5th class in Ing. and 6th class in Chech.
246|*peṭ|854|tub||ped||    Isolated in Ing., but with probable external parallels.
247|*mos|242|down, feather 1 tuft of hair|mas|mos||    4th class in Chech. and Ing. For PN a paradigm \I*mos,\i \I*masi-\i should be reconstructed (with vowel levelling in Chech.; cf. Chech. obl. \Imesa-\i).
248|*paꭓ|856|lung|paꭓ|peꭓk||    6th class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. The PN obl. form was \I*paꭓu-\i (to judge from Chech. \Ipoꭓa-\i); Ing. \Ipeꭓk\i goes back to a secondary diminutive \I*paꭓ-iḳ.\i
249|*ʔīp|857|mill kennel|āpari|ip||    PN paradigm: \I*ʔīp,\i \I*ʔāp-ar-\i (cf. also Ing. erg. \Iaparo\i); in Chech. the former oblique base became direct (a doublet form \Iapar\i exists also in Ing.). Chech. 4th class, Ing. 3d class.
250|*mutta (~-ṭṭ-)|858|juice|mutta|||
251|*pop|860|plane-tree|pop|pop||    Obl. base \I*popa-\i (cf. Chech. \Ipopa-,\i Ing. \Ipopo\i). 6th class in Chech., 3/5th class in Ing.
252|*patVr|245|down  1 goat's down|patar|petar||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. -r is originally a suffix (plural).
253|*hu(:)p|862|to blow, blowing|hup āla|||    Attested only in Chech., but with probable external parallels.
254|*par-lu (~-ō-,-ā-)|863|butterfly|polla|||    Since there is no Ing. form, several vocalic reconstructions for PN are possible. We assume that the final -la is a suffix, thus the original Inlaut resonant may have been -r- or -l-.
255|*puš|865|bump, lump|||puš|    Isolated in Bacb., but having reliable external parallels.
256|*lēp-|868|to glitter, to blaze|lēp-a|lep-a|lep-ar|
257|*baǯo|872|horned cattle|baža|bežan|bžã|    PN paradigm \I*baǯo,\i \I*baǯi-:\i cf. Chech. \Ibaža,\i \Ibeža-.\i For the direct base \I*baǯo\i cf. also Chech. Cheb., Khild., Shar. \Ibožo,\i Itumk. \Ibožu;\i Bacb. (with metathesis) \Ižabŏ\i 'horned cattle, herd'. There was also a PN derivate \I*baǯi-n(a\i) 'horned cattle', whence the Ing. form and Bacb. \Ibžã\i ( < \I*bažan\i), and also Chech. \Ibežana\i id.
258|*b(ɦ)ōl-ik (~-ʕ-)|875|grove|bȫlak|||    Isolated in Chech., but having probable external parallels (cf. even a similar suffix formation in Chech. and Darg.).
259|*ʁam-maʁa|1268|1 peach 2 apricot|ʁammaʁa 1|ʁamaʁa 2||
260|*buṭ ( ~ -ū-)|879|vulva|bud|bud||
261|*bāp-iḳ|887|bread (made of wheat, barley)|bēpig|||    Cf. also Cheb. \Ibāpig,\i Chech. obl. \Ibäpka-\i (pointing to *-ā-).
262|*ʔab-|890|to sew|||ʔab-|    Chech. and Ing. have not preserved the verb, but cf. in Chech. \Iew-na,\i Ing. \Iow\i 'seam'. Cf. also the PN derivate \I*jub\i (obl. \I*ʔabrV-\i) 'awl' (Bacb. \Ijub,\i Chech. \Ijū,\i pl. \Iʔāraš,\i Ing. \Ijuw,\i erg. \Iowro,\i pl. \Iowraš\i).
263|*p(ʕ)ott (~-ō-,-ṭṭ)|891|wooden bar|pott|||    Isolated in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
264|*pisV|853|pussy-cat|pisū|||    Isolated in Chech., with possible cognates in PL.
265|*č(ʕ)apu|892|foam, scum|čopa|||    Isolated in Chech., but with probable external parallels.
266|*b(ɦ)ārʒ|301|hillock|barz|bɔrz||    Obl. stem \I*bārʒu-\i (cf. Chech. \Iborza-\i and the Ing. \Ibɔrz,\i erg. \Ibɔrzo\i with vowel levelling in the direct stem). Cf. also Shar., Khild., It. \Ibārʒ.\i 6th class in Chech. and Ing.
267|*b(ɦ)eq̇V (~ -a-)|897|pole||beq̇a||    Isolated in Ing., thus the PN reconstruction is tentative. Nakh > Osset. (Dig.) \Ibäqä\i 'pole', see Abayev 1958, 250.
268|*b(ɦ)aḳa|899|1 pine-tree 2 resinous root of pine-tree|baga 1|baga 2||    3d class in Chech., 6th class in Ing.
269|*barVg|900|pick-axe|berg||brag|    In literary Chech. the root is present only as a compound element of \Izʕok-berg\i 'pick-axe'; cf., however, Itumk., Khild. \Iberg\i id. For Bacbian Matsiyev adduces also a form \Ibarg\i 'hammer for incising the mill-stone' which is probably a variant of the same root.
270|*buq̇|902|back|buq̇|buq̇|buq̇|    Obl. stem \I*buq̇a-\i (cf. Chech. \Ibuq̇a-,\i Ing. \Ibuq̇o\i), plur. \I*baq̇-bV-\i (Bacb. \Ibaq̇bi,\i Ing. \Ibowq̇a-š,\i Chech. \Ibaq̇a-š\i). 6th class in all languages.
271|*borc|898|millet|borc|borc|borc|    Obl. base \I*barci-\i (Chech. \Iberca-,\i Ing. \Iberco\i). 6th class in all languages.
272|*barλ (~-ā-)|2323|eight|barh|barh|barλ|
273|*bar-iḳ|906|hoof|berg|barg||    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. *-iḳ is a common diminutive suffix.
274|*bar(Ł)am|907|funeral stretcher|baram|||    Isolated in Chech. (thus *-rŁ-, *-rλ- or *-r- are equally possible), but having very probable external parallels.
275|*b(ɦ)ač̣Vn (~-ʕ-,-ǯ-)|908|rye|božan|||    In Uslar's notation: \Ibažaŋ.\i Since there are no Bacb. forms, both *-č̣- and *-ǯ- are possible in PN.
276|*čim|291|1 ashes 2 snow-flake|čim 1,2||čim 1|    Obl. base \I*čima-\i (Chech. \Ičima-\i). 5th class in Chech., 6th class in Bacb.
277|*ħub (~-ū-)|910|wound inflammation, caused by cold, dampness|ħū|ħuw||    4th class in Chech. and Ing. The original vowel length is impossible to establish.

The word contains different suffixes in Chech./Ing. and Bacb.; in Bacbi there was, additionally, a vowel metathesis.
279|*bumba-r- (~-ū-)|919|1 bumble-bee, hornet 2 beetle|bumbari|bumbarg||    Both form contain suffixes: Chech. \Ibumbari\i < \I*bumbar-Vj,\i Ing. \Ibumbarg\i < \I*bumbar-iḳ.\i 4th class in both languages.

In Bacb. the root is present also in the compound \Ijoħ-koṭŏ,\i \Idoħ-koṭŏ\i 'face' and in adverbs \I-ujħ-ṭeꭓ\i (with changing class prefixes) 'face down', \Idujħrẽ\i 'at first' and \Ijuħal\i 'on the other side (of a river, ravine)'.     The same root served as stem in the derivate \I*ɦi-ri-n\i ( < \I*-uHi-ri-n\i) 'sharp' > Chech., Ing. \Iira,\i Bacb. \Iʕirĩ.\i
285|*babV (~-ā-)|917|grandfather|||babŏ|    Attested only in Bacb., but having obvious parallels in other EC languages.
286|*marš (~-ā-)|931|muzzle|marš|||    Isolated in Chech. (obl. base \Imarša-\i), thus the vowel length is not clear.

294|*hoʔ ( ~ f-)|1602|bullet, projectile|hoʔ|||    Attested only in Chech. (obl. base \Ihöʔa-\i), but having probable external parallels. The meaning 'bullet' is, of course, secondary < 'arrow'.

296|*ḳāms(s)ur|225|canine tooth|ḳomsar|ḳomsar||    4th class in Chech. and Ing. Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Iḳōmsur,\i \Iḳōmsar,\i Shar. \Iḳōncur\i (with secondary -c-).
297|*ṭēwi|180|1 crossbeam 2 bridge 3 collar-bone, clavicle|ṭaj 1,2|ṭĳ 2|ṭiw 2,3|    The PN paradigm \I*ṭēwi,\i obl. \I*ṭāwi-\i is clearly reflected in Ing. \Iṭĳ,\i \Iṭäwo;\i Chech. has generalized the vocalism of the obl. stem (\Iṭaj\i < \I*ṭāj(i\i) < \I*ṭāwi,\i obl. \Iṭē-\i < \I*ṭāji-\i < \I*ṭāwi-\i). For Bacb. cf. also Desheriyev's notation: \Iṭew.\i 3d class in all languages.     The root originally meant just 'stick' or 'pole', cf. the Chech. diminutive \Iṭe-rg-aš\i (pl. t.) 'drumstick', and Ing. dial. \Iṭi(j\i) 'penis'.
298|*ḳēč̣|957|1 plait 2 wool|ḳāžar 1|ḳež 1|ḳeč̣ 2|    4th class in all languages. PN paradigm: \I*ḳēč̣,\i \I*ḳāč̣-ar-\i (cf. Ing. \Iḳež,\i erg. \Iḳažaro\i); in Chech. the oblique stem became direct.
299|*čarꭓ (~-ā-)|958|carcass|čarꭓ|||    Obl. stem \I*čarꭓu-\i (Chech. \Ičorꭓa-\i).

303|*nāna|272|mother|nāna|nana|nan|    Obl. stem \I*nāni-\i (cf. Chech. \Inēna-,\i Bacb. \Inani-\i); Ing., however, reflects \I*nānu-\i (Ing. pl. \Inona-š\i).
304|*pħars(s) (~-ā-)|970|arm|pħars|pħars|pħars|    Obl. base \I*pħarsi-\i (cf. Chech. \Ipħärsa-,\i (Uslar) \Ipħɛrsi-\i). Cf. also Chech. Shar., Khild. \Ipħarc.\i
305|*c̣an-ḳu|972|navel|c̣onga|c̣ong||    Cf. also Chech. It. \Ic̣ang.\i 3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. The form contains a suffix *-ḳu (probably a variant of the more usual diminutive *-iḳ).
306|*=ist|975|edge, end|=ist|=ist|bist|    Bacb. \Ibist\i in Matsiyev's notation (Kadagidze: \Ibisṭ\i). Vowel length unclear (because of the consonant cluster). One of the stems with changing class prefixes.
307|*čōrʁV (~-a-)|976|kennel, gutter; ravine|čorʁē|||    Attested only in Chech., thus the vocalic reconstruction (including the vowel length) not quite certain.
308|*b(ɦ)ārč|977|a wide seam on cloth|barč|barč||    The precise meaning is "a wide seam on cloth (for passing a lace etc.); the place for fitting a lace (in a bag)". Obl. base \I*b(ɦ)ārče-\i (cf. Chech. \Ibärča-\i). 6th class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
309|*jōħ|249|large intestine|jöħ||ajħi|    PN paradigm: \I*jōħ,\i \I*ʔāħi-.\i In Bacb. the former oblique stem became direct; in Chech., vice versa, the direct base became oblique: \I*jōħi-.\i In its turn, the new oblique base influenced the vocalism of the direct one (\Ijöħ\i).
310|*nugV (~-ū-,-b-,-d-)|981|besom|nuj|nuv||    Since there is no Bacb. form, any voiced stop may be reconstructed for PN. 6th class in Chech. and Ing.
311|*q̇amʔar-iḳ|982|throat, larynx|q̇amq̇arg|q̇amarg||    4th class in Chech. and Ing. The stem contains a frequent PN diminutive suffix *-iḳ.

315|*bʡar(λ)V|270|liver sausage|bʕara / baʕar|bʕar||    6th class in both languages. Since there is no Bacb. parallel, it is impossible to establish whether PN had *-λ- here or not.
316|*liṭṭ-|1543|to filter|litt-|litt-|liṭṭ-|    The verb stem is both terminative and durative in all languages.
317|*n(ɦ)ōsta (~-ṭ-)|999|1 leg (from foot to knee) 2 shin, shank|nosta|nost||    PN paradigm \I*n(ɦ)ōsta\i, \I*n(ɦ)āstar-\i (cf. Chech. \Inastara-,\i Ing. \Inastaro\i). 4th class in Chech. and Ing.

321|*morλ|1011|1 armful 2 to embrace|mor 1|morh 1|morλ-bar 2|    PN paradigm \I*morλ,\i \I*marλV-\i (cf. the archaic adv. Chech. \Imara\i "into one's arms", Bacb. \Imajrλa d-oλar\i 'to embrace'; the present obl. base Chech. \Imora-,\i Ing. \Imorho\i is a result of secondary vowel levelling). 6th class in Chech. and Ing.
322|*ṭal-iḳ|181|finger|ṭelg|ṭelg|ṭarḳ|    The stem contains a diminutive *-iḳ. Bacb. \Iṭarḳ\i instead of \I*ṭalḳ\i on analogy with \Ilarḳ\i 'ear', \Ibʕarḳ\i 'eye'. 6th class in all languages.
323|*bišV|1015|a child's hand|biši|||    Attested only in Chech. with a possible Tsez. parallel.
324|*gāʒV (~-c̣-)|1017|part of leg (thigh+shin+foot)||gɔz||    Attested only in Ing., but with probable external parallels.
325|*=āss-|1020|empty, hollow|=ässa|=ässa|=asẽ|    Cf. also Chech. Cheb. \I=āssẽ,\i Ved. \I=ēssẽ\i etc. The pure stem \I*=āss-\i is contained in Chech. \I=ass-ō,\i Bacb. \I=as-dã\i 'to empty'.
326|*ꭓā|1021|side (of body), hip|ꭓa|ꭓa|ꭓa|    Obl. base \I*ꭓā-ni-\i (Chech. \Iꭓē-na-,\i Ing. \Iꭓäno\i). 6th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing., 8th class in Bacb.
327|*kars (~ -ā-)|1022|1 rope of horse's hair 2 rope of goat's wool|kars 1|kars 1|karsã 2|    4th class in all languages. There is not enough information to establish the PN vowel length.
328|*ʁōlu-ḳ|158|bone for playing dice|ʁulg|ʁolg||    The stem contains a usual diminutive suffix. 3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
329|*māč̣V (~-ǯ-)|57|limb|mēžē|mäže||    A formation with a frequent *-VjV suffix. 4th class in both languages.
330|*ħaqV|1024|ankle, ankle-bone|ħaqolg|ħaqing||    4th class in both languages. Without suffix cf. Chech. Pharch. \Iħaqo\i id.
331|*ħāqu-m (~ *ħōqa-m)|265|knee-cap|ħōqam|||    Attested only in Chech., but with probable external parallels.

333|*garʒa (~-ā-,-c̣-)|3|noodles|garza|garza||    4th class in both languages.
334|*pħiṭ|1028|calf of leg|pħid|pħid||    Obl. base \I*pħiṭa-\i (Chech. \Ipħida-,\i Ing. \Ipħido\i). The word is homonymous with \I*pħiṭ\i 'frog' (q.v.) which is a secondary merger.
335|*ḳaru|12|coal|ḳora|ḳor|ḳor|    5th class in Chech., Ing., b in Bacb. Cf. also Shar. \Iḳoro,\i Khild. \Iḳoru,\i Cheb. \Iḳaru\i - proving the reconstruction with *-a-. The form \Iḳor\i in Bacb. is irregular (\I*ḳajru\i should be expected) and still has to be explained.
336|*neħ|206|1 skin 2 skin (for making soles)|neʕ|niħ|niħ|    Obl. stem \I*naħa-ra-\i (cf. Ing. \Inaħaro,\i Chech. with vowel levelling \Ineʕara-\i). 3d class in all languages.
337|*m(ɦ)il-(~*-ī-,-Ł-)|20|1 from cold, with cold (adv.) 2 to get cold|mil-la 1||mil-dar 2|    Vowel length and the precise quality of the lateral are hard to establish (the Bacb. stem is known only in Kadagidze's notation).
338|*barḳal (~ -a-)|37|1 lumps of dirt in animals' hair 2 bad,dirty wool|bargal 1||barḳal 2|
339|*m(ɦ)ēꭓV (~-ʕ-,-ā-)|1032|leather strip to be cut in threads; harness thread|mēꭓa|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.

341|*kondV-r (~-a-)|339|1 crown of a tree; a k. of weed 2 savory|kondar 1|kondar 2|kondar 2|    Forms with the meaning 'weed, savory' may be loaned from Georgian (cf. Georg. \Ikondari\i); however, a reverse direction of borrowing is also possible.
342|*ḳāc̣e|25|puppy|ḳēza|ḳaza|ḳac̣(ĕ)|    Obl. base \Iḳāc̣i-\i (Chech. \Iḳēza-,\i Ing. \Iḳäzo\i). Cf. also Cheb. \Iḳāze,\i Khild. \Iḳēʒĕ,\i Ved. \Iḳēze\i etc. 3d class in all languages.
343|*(p)s(ɦ)ārV|50|long switch, long branch; wire|sāra|särg||    In Ing. - a form with the diminutive *-ḳ (cf. also Chech. (Usl.) \Isārag\i id.). 6th class in both languages. Since there is no Bacb. reflex, it is impossible to determine whether we deal with PN *s- or *ps-, and whether there was a medial laryngeal. External evidence is in favour of PN \I*psɦārV.\i
344|*ḳuč̣|56|1 forelock, tuft of hair 2 mountain top|ḳuž 1|ḳuž 1|ḳuč̣ 1,2|    Obl. base \I*ḳuč̣e-\i (cf. Chech. \Iḳüža-,\i Ing. \Iḳužo\i). 6th class in all languages. Cf. also Khild. \Iḳuǯ,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Iḳuč:,\i Chech. \Iḳuž-al\i 'fringe, forelock'.
345|*kōč-Vr (~ *kāč-ur)|1037|bundle (of onions, garlic etc.)|kōčar|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
346|*ꭓāl|1046|a piece of thread|ꭓal|||    Obl. base \I*ꭓāli-\i (Chech. \Iꭓēla-\i). Attested only in Chech., but having good external parallels.

348|*ħāso|1042|1 golden threads 2 woollen threads|ħāsa|ħɔsa|ħas|    Obl. stem \I*ħāsi-\i (Chech. \Iħēsa-,\i Ing. \Iħäso\i). 6th class in all languages.
349|*ʔāꭓ-ni|1043|woollen thread, yarn|ēꭓang|äꭓing|ajꭓnĭ|    Bacb. reflects the form \I*ʔāꭓ-ni\i (with an old *-ni suffix); Chech. and Ing. reflect the further suffixation \I*ʔāꭓ-ni-ḳ\i (with diminutive *-ḳ). 3d class in Chech., Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
350|*pꭓā|1044|vein|pꭓa|pꭓa|pꭓa|    Obl. stem \I*pꭓā-ni-\i (Chech. \Ipꭓēna-,\i Ing. \Ipꭓäno\i). 6th class in all languages.
351|*samV-ḳ (~ -ā-)|1045|sausage made of a large intestine|samg|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.

353|*č̣ʡōr|1049|1 skin, envelope 2 shell, peel|č̣q̇or 1|č̣or 2|č̣ar 1|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing., 5th class in Bacb. Chech. and Ing. point to an obl. stem \I*č̣ʡōru-\i (Chech. \Ič̣q̇ūra-,\i Ing. \Ič̣oro\i). However, there must have existed an obl. base with Ablaut \I*č̣ʡārV-\i reflected in Bacb. as the direct base.
354|*ʔān|53|rheumatic pain, rheumatism|ān|a|ã|    Obl. base \I*ʔāne-,\i cf. Chech. \Iēna-,\i Ing. \Iano,\i Bacb. \Iani-.\i 3d class in all languages.
355|*d(ɦ)o (~-ʕ-)|1055|ear-wax|do|||    Obl. base \Ido-na-.\i Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
356|*ʔirc̣V (~ʕ,ɦ,ī,-ʒ-)|195|stubbed ground; a sown forest clearing|irzū|||    The word is attested only in Chech. (-ū is a nominal suffix), thus there may be several variants of the PN reconstruction.
357|*ʔēʁ-|1058|1 to fight, quarrel 2 to be upset|ēʁ- 1|eʁ- 1|eʁ- 2|
358|*m(ɦ)arš|1057|snot|marš|meraž||    The word is homonymous (as a result of secondary contaminations): in Chech. with \Imarš\i 'muzzle',in Ing. - with \Imeraž\i 'nose' (PN different roots: \I*marš\i and \I*marλo\i respectively). This explains the apparent irregularity of correspondences.
359|*ħett (~-ē-,-ṭṭ)|1059|herpes, eczema|ħätt|ħett||    Obl. stem \I*ħatt-ar-\i (Chech. \Iħattara-,\i Ing. \Iħattaro\i). Vowel length unknown. 4th class in Chech. and Ing.
360|*pħač̣ (~-ǯ)|1060|horse's dung|pħaž|pħaž||    Obl. base \I*pħač̣u-\i (Chech. \Ipħoža-;\i Ing. with vowel levelling \Ipħažo\i). 6th class in Chech., 5th class in Ing.
361|*m(ɦ)āq̇V (~-ʕ-)|1063|snot, mucus from the nose|mēq̇-alg|||    An expressive suffixed form (with suffixes *-il+iḳ).
362|*m(ɦ)ōq|1064|rust|mēqa|muq||    The PN paradigm should be reconstructed as \I*m(ɦ)ōq\i ( > Ing. \Imuq\i), \I*m(ɦ)āqi-\i (the former obl. stem having superseded the direct one in Chech.). 4th class in both languages.
363|*stim|1065|gall|stim|sim|sem|    Obl. base \I*stima-\i (Chech. \Istima-,\i Ing. \Isimo\i); 5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing.
364|*mār|68|husband|mar|mar|mar|    Obl. base \I*māre-\i (Chech. \Imēra-,\i Ing. \Imaro\i). Cf. also Pharch. \Imār\i id. More used in Chech. is the derivate form \Imajra\i ( < \I*mārV-ja\i) 'husband; brave, brave man'.
365|*ħāṭq̇a|1067|urine|ħaṭq̇a||ħajṭq̇ĭ|    Vowel length determined because of Bacb. dyphthongization (a short *a would not yield -aj- in this position). Obl. base \I*ħāṭq̇u-\i (Chech. \Iħoṭq̇a-,\i Bacb. \Iħaṭq̇u-\i). 3d class in both languages.
366|*b(ɦ)eṭ (~-ē-)|107|faeces||bɛd (dial.)||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
367|*bʕēꭓu-|1071|dirty|bȫꭓa|bʕeꭓa||
368|*j(ɦ)olk|1074|sediment after boiling butter|jök-aš|lok||    The Chech. form is a pluralis tantum. The PN -l- must be reconstructed to account for the exceptional correlation Chech. j- : Ing. l-.
369|*ḳiḳ|1075|1 bead 2 button 3 smallpox|ḳig 3 (Pkharch)|ḳig 2,3|ḳiḳ 1|    3d class in Ing., 6th class in Bacb.
370|*c̣VwVn (~ -b-)|1078|dungwash|c̣ūn|c̣un||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. We have to suppose a contraction to account for the Chech. vowel length (old long vowels are shortened in a closed syllable).
371|*far- (~ -ā-)|1081|sheep's dung||far-ast||    The Ing. word is a compound; the second component is most probably a distorted PN \I*lust\i 'dung, sheep's dung'.
372|*q̇anṭ-al (~ -ā-)|1083|snivel, mucus from the nose||q̇andal||    Attested only in Ing., but with probable external parallels.
373|*mʕuṭe|1084|1 dirt 2 dirt (on face, body, cloth)|moda 2|mʕad 2|mujṭĭ 1|    PN paradigm \I*mʕuṭe,\i obl. \I*mʕaṭV-;\i the obl. base superseded the direct one in Chech. (where \Imoda\i < \I*mʕaṭu-\i) and Ing. 4th class in Chech., Ing., 6th class in Bacb. Cf. also Bacb. \Imuṭo-rĕ(n\i) 'dirty'.
374|*ʁarʁV (~ -ā-)|1085|crumbs of bread||ʁarʁa||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
375|*naṭq̇u|1091|pus|noṭq̇a|nod|noṭq̇|    In Bacb. \Inoṭq̇\i in Kadagidze's notation; Desheriyev writes \Inaṭq̇\i (which is the more expected variant). Obl. base \I*naṭq̇-ar-,\i cf. Chech. \Inaṭq̇ara-,\i Ing. \Inadq̇aro\i (showing that the loss of -q̇ in the direct base is a recent phenomenon). Note that in Bacb. the plural \Inaṭq̇-ajrĭ\i means "tears" (cf. the meaning in all other EC languages). 4th class in all languages.
376|*tuj (~ -ū-)|1092|spit, spittle|tuj|tu-g|tuj|    In Ing. - a diminutive form (\I*tu(j)-ḳ\i). It is impossible to establish vowel length. 3d class in Chech., Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
377|*dāꭓo-ni|1096|cattle|däꭓni|dɔꭓan|daꭓnĕ|    3d class in all languages.
378|*gub (~ -ū-)|1097|1 hill, barrow 2 island|gū 1|guw 1|gub 2 (Schiefner)|    6th class in Chech. and Ing. The Bacb. form is quoted from Schiefner; Kadagidze has only Bacb. \Igub\i 'pool' which is obviously borrowed from Georg. \Igube\i 'pool, pond'.
379|*ħāꭓ|1098|mountain goat|ħeꭓ|ħaʁ|ħaꭓ|    The reason for voicing -ꭓ > -ʁ in Ing. is unclear. In Chech. the vowel -e- is due to analogy with the oblique base \Iħēꭓara-\i ( < \I*ħāꭓi-ri-\i). 3d class in Chech., 6th class in all languages.
380|*ʁala|1099|doe|ʁala|ʁala||    6th class in both languages.
381|*šo|1101|mountain goat|šo|||    The Chech. word is quoted from Карасаев-Мациев 1978, thus vowel length and paradigm are unknown.
382|*ħāl-ĳ|1104|cows (pl.)|ħēlī|ħälĳ||
383|*jētt|1106|cow|jett|jett|jett|    Obl. base \I*ʕātti-,\i cf. Chech. \Iätta-,\i Ing. erg. \Iʕatto,\i Bcb. \Iatti-.\i 6th class in Chech., Ing., 4th class in Bacb.
384|*ḳornV|1108|young (of an animal), nestling|ḳorni|ḳorig||    Cf. also Chech. (Uslar) \Iḳornaj.\i The Ing. form is probably a contraction of \I*ḳornaj-iḳ\i with elision of -n-.
385|*ʕāsse|1113|calf|ēsa|ʕasa|āsĕ|    The Bacb. notation of Kadagidze (\Iāsĕ\i) stands obviously for \Iassĕ\i (Bacb. has lost long vowels); cf. also \Iassĕ\i in Imnaishvili's notation.      Obl. base \I*ʕāssi-\i (cf. Chech. \Iēsa-,\i Ing. \Iʕäso\i); 3d class in Chech., Ing., 5th class in Bacb. Cf. also a derived form: Bacb. \Iasaʔŏ\i (Imnaishvili: \Iassaʔŏ\i) 'heifer'.
386|*c̣in (~ -ī-)|1114|1 sheep (about 1 y. old) 2 ram (about 1 y. old)|c̣in-tō 2|c̣un-to 2|c̣in 1|    In Chech. and Ing. the root is present only in compounds (cf. also Chech. \Ic̣in-žī\i 'sheep about 1 y. old'). Since the root is homonymous with \I*c̣in-\i 'new' (having a quite distinct origin), these compounds may now be reinterpreted as 'new sheep' or 'new ram'; however, a separate usage of the stem \Ic̣in\i in Bacb. shows that this is a secondary situation. Cf. also Osset. \Ic̣ɨnär\i / \Ic̣inär\i 'dry (goat, cow or sheep)', probably borrowed from Nakh.
387|*ʔābst (~ɦ-,-ṭ)|1116|goat (about 1 y. old)|awst|ɔsta||    4th class in both languages.
388|*bader (~ -ā-)|1121|child|ber|ber|bader|    Chech. obl. base \Ibēra-.\i
389|*gile|1125|horse, steed|gila|gila||    6th class in both languages.
390|*bʡar (~ -ā-)|1126|1 look, sight 2 to meet, look, stare|bʕar 1|bʕar ħaža 2|bʕar-daꭓar 2|    The root is very close phonetically to PN \I*bʡa\i 'eye' (q.v.), but external parallels show that it must be kept distinct. For the short vowel in PN cf. Chech. obl. stem \Ibʕära-\i (also used in \Ibʕära ħēža\i 'to stare' = Ing. \Ibʕar-ħaža\i).
391|*ʔāʁo-b|1127|side|āʁō|ɔʁuw||    Cf. also Cheb. \Iāʁaw,\i Lev. \Iāʁwō\i id.
392|*bʡārc̣on|672|mule|bʕarza|bʕarza|bʕarc̣õ|    Cf. also Shar. \Ibʕorʒõ,\i Itumk. \Ibʕārʒã\i (pointing to a long vowel in PN). 4th class in Chech., Ing., 5th class in Bacb. In Ing. we would expect \I*bʕɔrza;\i the form \Ibʕarza\i is probably a result of vowel levelling (on analogy with the obl. base \I*bʡārc̣ana-\i).
393|*ḳōṭi|1137|cat|||ḳujṭĭ|    5th class; pl. \Iḳoṭa-rči.\i
394|*ħā-|2295|who (obl. stem)|ħa (erg.)|ħa (erg.)|ħa (erg.)|    Cf. also Chech. gen. \Iħē-na-\i etc. The stem also serves for building relative and indefinite pronouns (Chech. \Iħē-neꭓ\i 'someone', Bacb. \Iħane\i '...who,...which' etc.).
395|*kōta-m|1141|hen|kōtam|kotam|kotam|    Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Ikwōtam.\i 4th class in Chech., Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
396|*ča|1146|bear|ča|ča|ča|    4th class in all languages. Short vowel is reconstructed on basis of forms like Chech. dat. \Iče-na.\i
397|*bɦorc̣|1147|wolf|borz|borz|bʕorc̣|    Obl. base \I*bɦarc̣i-,\i cf. Chech. \Iberza-,\i Ing. \Iberzo,\i Bacb. plur. \Ibʕarc̣e-lš.\i Cf. also Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Ibworʒ\i / \Ibworc:,\i Chech. Cheb. \Ibworz,\i Khild. \Ibworʒ\i etc. 4th class in Chech., Ing., 6th class in Bacb.
398|*kōri|1148|hawk|kǖra|ker|kujr|    Cf. also Bacb. pl. \Ikore-lč,\i Chech. Cheb. \Ikwōri,\i Shar. \Ikū(ʔ)ri\i, Ved. \Ikwīri\i etc. Since the PN form has very reliable EC parallels, we must assume that Georg. \Ikori\i 'hawk' is an old Nakh loan (preserving the PN phonetic structure).
399|*cɦōḳal|1149|fox|cħōgal|cogal|coḳal|    3d class in all languages.
400|*lar-iḳ|1151|hare||lerg||    The simple stem meaning 'hare' is preserved in Ing. Since the word is homonymous with \Ilerg\i ( < \I*lariḳ\i) 'ear', in Chech. it was reinterpreted and is now only used within a compound \Ilerg-jāꭓar\i 'hare', lit. 'ear'+'long'.
401|*pħā-ḳal|1152|hare|pħāgal|pħagal|pꭓaḳal|    4th class in Chech., Ing., dd in Bacb. Reasons for irregular development in Bacb. (*pħ- > pꭓ-) are unclear.
402|*=ōʁ- / *=ēbʁ-|96|1 to erect, plant 2 to sit|=ōʁ-|=oʁ- 1, =aʁ- 2|=oʁ- 1, =aʁ- 2|    PN \I*=ōʁ-\i is the terminative stem; durative (with infix and Ablaut) \I*=ē-b-ʁ-\i is reflected in Chech. \I=īʁ-\i (with the same meaning).     The intransitive Ablaut correlate with *-ā- is PN \I*=āʁ-\i 'to sit'. Vowel length here can be established by the Ing. pret. \I=äʁaw.\i In Bacb. the root is preserved in the compound \Iʕe=aʁ-\i "to sit". This is one of the relatively rare cases of the *a/*o "intransitive/ transitive" Ablaut in PN.
403|*masor|566|1 mountain goat 2 chamois|masar 1|mosar 2|masor 2|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
404|*ʕāq̇i|98|stone plate, flat stone|ēq̇a|ʕäq̇a|ajq̇ĭ|    4th class in Chech., Ing., 6th class in Bacb. Cf. also Chech. Cheb., Shar. \Iʕāq̇i,\i Lev. \Iʕēq̇i\i id. and a derivate: Chech. \Iōq̇am\i ( < \I*ʕāq̇u-m\i) 'boulder; block of ice'.
405|*lVwV|1156|roe|lū|lĳ-g||    3d class in Chech. and Ing. (the Ing. form is a diminutive < \I*lVw-iḳ\i). Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Ilū\i 'mountain goat'. Since there is no Bacb. form, the Inlaut is not quite clear (theoretically, *-w-, *-b-, *-d- or *-g- may be reconstructed).
406|*bula|1157|aurochs|bula|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
407|*bur(u)ḳ́ (~ -ū-,-ḳ)|1159|pig, piglet|||buruḳ|    Attested only in Bacb. (thus *-ḳ or *-ḳ́) are equally probable), but having probable external parallels.
408|*ǯarʁa (~ -ā-)|1160|sow, pig|žarʁa|žarʁa||    4th class in both languages. There are not enough data to establish vowel length. Nakh > Osset. \Iʒärɣ\i / \Iʒärɣä\i (see Abayev 1958, 395).
409|*šVrṭq̇V|1162|weasel|šaṭq̇a|šurṭq̇a||    6th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing. Vocalism is irregular.
410|*daꭓḳa|1164|mouse|daꭓka|daꭓka|daꭓḳŏ|    6th class in all languages. Obl. base \I*daꭓḳi-,\i cf. Chech. \Ideꭓka-,\i Ing. \Ideꭓko,\i Bacb. \Idaꭓḳe-.\i
411|*dingV-ṭ (~-ī-,-ḳ-)|1166|weasel|dingad|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.

413|*c̣ic|1169|1 weasel 2 rat|c̣eca-joqqurg 1|cic-ꭓolg 2||    On basis of Chech. \Ic̣eca-\i and Ing. \Icic-\i (with assimilation < \Ic̣ic-\i) a PN paradigm \I*c̣ic,\i \I*c̣aci-\i can be reconstructed. The simple root is not attested; it is present only within a compound \I*c̣aci-joqqV-riḳ\i (\I*c̣ic-joqqV-riḳ\i), distorted phonetically in Ing. \Icicꭓolg,\i and meaning literally "a big \I*c̣ic"\i (\I*j-oqqa\i 'big').     The same root with a simple diminutive suffix \I*c̣ic-iḳ\i (and with assimilation > \I*cic-iḳ\i) means "cat" in Chech.-Ing. (Chech. \Icicig,\i Ing. \Icisḳ\i).
414|*č̣ʡorṭ (~ -ʕ-,-ō-)|178|lark||č̣q̇ord||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
415|*kōr|1177|window|kor|kor|kor|    Obl. base \I*kōra-\i (Chech. \Ikōra-,\i Ing. \Ikoro\i). 5th class in Chech. and Bacb.

417|*q̇ag-iḳ|118|crow|q̇ig|q̇ajg||    4th class in Chech. and Ing.; cf. also Chech. obl. \Iq̇īga-.\i Note that Bacb. \Iq̇oʔ\i (Desheriyev: \Iq̇waʔ\i) is not related here, but obviously borrowed from Georg. \Iq̇waw-i\i 'crow'.
418|*č̣āʁV|1188|magpie|č̣ēʁag|||    -ag is a common diminutive suffix. Isolated in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
419|*č̣āʁVrṭ-iḳ|1190|swallow|č̣ēʁardig|č̣agarg||    An expressive stem with some irregular changes (notably in Ing.: *-ʁ- > -g- by assimilation to the following g).
420|*mɦāqqVl|1191|kite|maqqal|||    Cf. also Shar. \Imʕaqqil,\i Akk. \Imʕāqqal,\i Cheb., Ved. \Imaqqil.\i The intervocalic geminate -qq- is either expressive or a result of some cluster simplification (unfortunately there is no Bacb. evidence which would clarify the case).     Nakh > Osset. \Imäqqɨl,\i \Imäqäl\i / \Imiḳil\i 'a bird of prey' (see Abayev 1973, 94-95 - also linking Osset. \Imäqqäl\i 'Ingush' as a zoomorphic ethnonym).
421|*guguṭṭ|1193|cuckoo|||guguṭṭ|    Preserved only in Bacb., but having good external parallels.
422|*qaqu|1195|pigeon|qoqa|qoq|qawqŭ|    6th class in all languages. Cf. also Cheb. \Iqaqu,\i Shar., Ved. etc. \Iqoqu\i id.

425|*māšu|1201|partridge|mōša|mɔš||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. Cf. also Cheb. \Imāšu,\i Akk. \Imōša,\i Shar. \Imōšu\i etc.

429|*šulṭq̇V|1208|1 lizard 2 a k. of lizard ("медяница")|šaṭq̇am 2|šulq̇a 1||    The PN form is probably a reduction < \I*šulṭ-iḳV\i (with a common diminutive suffix). The Chech. form has a secondary suffixed -m, joined to the original oblique base \I*šalṭq̇V-\i (with Ablaut). 6th class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
430|*ʁōn-|624|louse|ʁēn-ig|ʁon-g||    The Chech. and Ing. forms both contain a diminutive suffix -g ( < *-Vḳ), but the Ing. form is derived from the old direct stem \I*ʁōn(V\i), while the Chech. form - from the old oblique stem \I*ʁān(V\i)-. 3d class in both languages.
431|*šāri (~ -e)|1209|earwig|šēra, šār-olg|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.

434|*ṭoṭ|1218|1 gadfly 2 fly|ṭod 1||ṭuṭ 2|    6th class in both languages. Reason for narrowing *-o- > -u- in Bacb. is not quite clear. Obl. base \I*ṭoṭa-,\i cf. Chech. \Iṭoda-.\i
435|*maʒu|1219|fly|moza|moza||    6th class in both languages. Cf. also Chech. (in Uslar's notation) \Imɔzu,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Imwoz.\i

439|*cāpcV-|1226|cricket|cäpcalg|||    Attested only in Chech. (-al-g is a common expressive suffix), but having probable external parallels.

443|*c̣oc̣ ( ~ -ʒ)|1234|locust|c̣oz|c̣oz||    3d class in both languages. Oblique base \I*c̣ac̣i-\i (\I*c̣aʒi-\i), cf. Chech. \Ic̣eza-,\i Ing. \Ic̣ezo.\i
444|*gec̣-iḳ ( ~ -ʒ-)|1235|spider|gezg|gizg||    4th class in both languages. Cf. also Chech. (in Uslar's notation) \Igezig,\i pointing to a short vowel.

448|*c̣ārc̣|1239|a tree species|c̣arz|||    Vowel length established because of -ä- in plural (pl. \Ic̣ärz-naš\i). The root is attested only in Chech., but has probable external parallels.
449|*laq-en|142|high, tall|leqa|laqa|laqẽ|    Cf. also the root \I*laq-\i in Chech. \Ilaqa\i 'upwards', Bacb. \Ilaq-na\i 'high up'.
450|*bac̣a ( ~ -ʒ-)|1241|fir-tree|baza|baza||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
451|*dak|1242|1 willow 2 a species of willow ("козья верба")|dak 1|dak 1|dakŏ 2|    Obl. stem \I*daku-\i (cf. Chech. \Idoka-;\i Ing. obl. \Idako\i is a result of vowel levelling; the Bacb. form possibly reflects the old obl. stem). 4th class in Ing., 3d class in Chech., Bacb.
452|*ħabꭓV|1243|shady slope of a mountain|ħäwꭓē|ħowꭓe||    The Chech.-Ing. form contains a locative suffix -ē.
453|*ʒēʒ|1244|larch|zez|||    Obl. base \I*ʒēʒu-\i (Chech. \Izȫza-\i). Attested only in Chech., but having reliable external parallels.
454|*c̣on-|1246|a k. of bush|c̣una dečig|c̣on||    It is not quite clear, what kind of bush is meant. In the Ing.-Chech.-Russ. dictionary both words are glossed as 'a k. of bush'; in the Chech.-Russ. dictionary (where the form is \Ic̣ulla dečig\i, probably < \I*c̣un-la;\i \Idečig\i = 'wood, tree') the gloss is 'a k. of bush with hard wood'.
455|*t(ɦ)ātV|1248|1 a k. of weed 2 weed|tāti 1|tatam 2||    4th class in Chech., 5th class in Ing. Both forms have suffixes (-i < *-Vj in Chech., -am in Ing.).
456|*maʔ|1256|alder-tree|maʔ|miʔing||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*maʔu-\i (cf. Chech. \Imoʔa-\i). The Ing. form contains a diminutive suffix (*-Vḳ); the vocalism is irregular (probably a late assimilation \I*maʔinḳ\i > \I*meʔinḳ\i > \Imiʔing\i).
457|*ṭq̇aw|167|rain mixed with snow|ṭq̇ow|ṭq̇ow||    4th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*ṭq̇awni-\i (cf. Chech. \Iṭq̇ewna-\i).

The Ing. direct base \Ipꭓän\i is a back-building from the oblique base. In Chech. the word is glossed as "hornbeam; plane-tree".
461|*datta ( ~ -ā-)|1262|rowan tree|datta||tatt|    The Chech. word is quoted from the Russ.-Chech. dictionary, thus class, obl. stem and vowel length are unknown. Bacb. \Itatt\i is probably a result of assimilation ( < \I*datt\i).
462|*bʡār(λ)a|169|nut|bʕāra|bʕar||    3d class in both languages. Cf. also Chech. \Ibʕällang,\i Ing. \Ibʕäring\i ( \I*bʡār(λ)-li-nVḳ\i) 'nut-tree'.

471|*kamiʒ/*kamis(/-mus)|1277|grape|kems|koms|kaniz|    4th class in all languages. Variation *ʒ/*s reflects two old PEC variants (present also in other languages). The Chech. and Bacb. forms reflect a vocalic variant \I*kamis\i (\I*kamiʒ\i), but Ing. \Ikoms\i presupposes a form \I*kamus.\i
472|*stōm|1280|fruit|stom|som|som|    Obl. base \I*stōme-\i (cf. Chech. \Istȫma-\i). 5th class in all languages.

475|*ʒaʒV / *ʒēʒV|1284|1 blossom 2 flower|zaza 1, zēzig 2|ziza 2||    An expressive root; the variants \Izaza\i and \Izēzi-g\i in Chech. hardly should be kept separate.
476|*(ʔă)stVw|1285|cornel|stow|esti||    Chech. has reduced the first weak syllable, preserved in Ing. (\Iesti\i < \I*ʔăstVw\i).
477|*ħarVmV-|1279|sweetbrier|ħarmik|ħandar||    The forms are quoted from the Ing.-Chech.-Russ. dictionary. The Russ-Chech-Ing. and the Russ.-Chech. dictionaries list Chech. \Iħärmak\i 'sweetbrier', and the Chech-Russ. dictionary - Chech. \Iħärmak\i 'root-crop'. These all are obviously dialectal variants.
478|*ħanḳ́-al ( ~ -ḳ-)|1286|sweetbrier|||ħanḳal|    It is possible that Chech. \Iel-ħamč\i 'hawthorn' goes back to the same root (with irregular deglottalisation: we would expect \I*ħanč̣-\i).
479|*nēlꭓ-in|212|thin, sparse|nilꭓa|nīlꭓa|netꭓĩ|    Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Injelꭓĩ,\i Khild. \Inīꭓĭ,\i Akk. \Injerꭓa.\i The pure root may be observed in Chech. \Inilꭓ-dan\i 'make thin, sparse', Bacb. \Inetꭓ-dar\i id.
480|*boṭ|1291|dough|bod|bod|boṭ|    Obl. base \I*baṭi-,\i cf. Chech. \Ibeda-,\i Ing. \Ibedo,\i Bacb. pl. \Ibaṭa-š.\i 5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. and Bacb. A derivate in Ing. is \Ibod-ig\i 'grass' (cf. the variation "cereal / flour" in other EC languages).
481|*ʔarV ( ~ -ē-)|1293|wild hemp||eri||    Attested only in Ing., but having possible external parallels.
482|*ꭓ-āṭ- / *ꭓ-ēṭ-|217|to be torn, break|ꭓād- / ꭓēd-|ꭓad-|ꭓeṭ-|    PN Ablaut *ā / *ē (but cf. also Bacb. term. \Iꭓiṭ-\i). Cf. also Chech. \Iꭓād-ō,\i \Iꭓēd-ō\i 'to cut'. Historically *ꭓ- is a preverb.
483|*ʡa(gV)b ( ~ -ā-)|1294|1 millet 2 groats|ʕow|ʕow||    4th class in both languages. Since there is no Bacb. parallel, the reconstruction is rather tentative (\I*ʡagVb,\i corresponding to Av. \Iogób\i etc., is the most probable choice).
484|*sōs|1298|a sort of rye|sos|||    Obl. base \I*sōsa-\i ( ~ \I*sāsu-\i), cf. Chech. \Isōsa-.\i
485|*duḳa|1299|1 rice 2 groats|duga 1,2|duga||    3d class in both languages.
486|*psa ( ~ -ā)|1300|barley|||psa|    Attested only in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
487|*mūq|1301|1 barley 2 baked bread|muq 1|muq 1, mäq 2|majqĭ 2|    PN paradigm: \I*mūq,\i obl. \I*māqi-\i (cf. Chech. \Imuq,\i \Imēqa-,\i Ing. \Imuq,\i \Imäqo,\i Cheb. \Imuq,\i \Imāqi-\i). 6th class in Ing. and Chech. The oblique stem \I*māqi\i used as direct ("barley's, stemming from barley") is used in the meaning "bread" in Ing. and Bacb.
488|*l(ɦ)ōṭ ( ~ -ʕ-)|1302|waste of corn (corn lost during transportation)|lod|||    Obl. base \Ilōda-.\i Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
489|*gVg|1307|seed, grain||gi||    Attested only in Ing., thus a variety of PN reconstructions is possible; we choose medial *-g- because of external evidence.
490|*ʔāsor ( ~ -ss-)|1318|weed; weeding|āsar|ɔsar||    3d class in Chech. and Ing.
491|*jōl|1319|hay|jol|jol|jol|    Obl. base \I*ʔāli-\i (cf. Chech. \Iēla-,\i Ing. \Iälo,\i Bacb. \Iali-\i). 4th class in all languages.
492|*n(ɦ)iṭṭ ( ~ -ī-)|1320|nettle|nitt|nitt|niṭṭ|    Obl. base \I*n(ɦ)iṭṭe-\i (Chech. \Initta-,\i Ing. \Initto\i). 5th class in Chech., Ing., 6th class in Bacb. External evidence demands some laryngeal in this root; *nɦ- should be reflected as nʕ- in Bacb., but such a combination does not exist before front vowels. We may thus think that the PN form was actually \I*nɦiṭṭ,\i but the laryngeal was lost in all modern languages.
493|*măʁVl-ṭ|1322|cockle, weed|merʁad|maʁaldi||    4th class in Chech., but 3d class in Ing. The vowel's shortness is indicated by Chech. -e- (a long *-ā- in this position would yield -ä-). In Chech. there occurred a metathesis (\I*maʁVlṭ\i > \I*malʁVṭ\i with a subsequent change -l- > -r-).     Nakh > Osset. \Imäɣälda\i 'cockle, weed' (Abayev 1973, 83).
494|*dēcV ( ~ -ā-)|243|paternal aunt|dēca|||    Within Chech. \Idēca\i is opposed to \Inēca\i 'maternal aunt' (cf. \Ida\i 'father' and \Inana\i 'mother'). Both terms, however, have different EC etymologies, and the analogy with 'father' and 'mother' (which influenced there meaning) must be secondary.
495|*šōṗV|1324|a k. of ramson|šēbu / šöp|šüp||    All forms are quoted from Алироев 1975 (also listed there are Kist. \Išüp\i and Cheb. \Išopu\i) and their dialectal attribution is not quite clear (that is why there are problems with vocalic reconstruction). The precise meaning of the root is "ramson with broad leaves and stronger smell and taste".
496|*šowV ( ~ -ō-, -ū-)|1325|a k. of ramson|šu ( ~ šū)|šū||    The Chech. word is cited from the Russ.-Chech. dictionary, thus vowel length is unclear.
497|*sṭim ( ~ -ī-)|1326|1 wormwood, absinth 2 hellebore|stim-urꭓa 2||sṭim 1|    Forms are quoted from Алироев 1975, 159, 161. The component -urꭓa in Chech. is unclear.
498|*sVbVr-(-g-,-d-,-w-)|1327|a k. of marsh plant|sōr-am|||    Attested only in Chech., thus a variety of PN reconstructions is possible.
499|*jōšV ( ~ *jāšu)|1329|a k. of odorous weed|jōša|||    Attested only in Chech. (and should be distinguished from \Ijūša\i 'wormwood, absinth' < Pers. \Ijawšon\i), but having probable external parallels.
500|*bʡast ( ~ -ʕ-,-ā-)|1330|name of a mountain weed|||bʕäst (Matsiyev)|    Attested only in Batsb., but having possible external parallels.
501|*m(ɦ)ŏħ|1331|cry, moan|moħ|muħ||    6th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*maħe-r-\i (cf. Chech. \Imäħara-,\i Ing. \Imaħaro\i).
502|*m(ɦ)uǯ-(~ʕ,ū,ō,o,č̣)|1333|plantain|müžg|||    A diminutive form (in *-iḳ). Since only the Chech. form is attested, the PN reconstruction is rather tentative (several possibilities are available).
503|*šiš|1334|1 ergot, spur 2 a k. of weed (волчье лыко)|šiš 1|šiš 2||    Obl. stem \I*šišV-\i (cf. Chech. \Išiša-\i). 5th class in both languages.
504|*č̣im|1335|1 a plant with an edible root (купырь лесной)|č̣im|č̣im|č̣im|    Obl. base \I*č̣ima-\i (Chech. \Ič̣ima-,\i Ing. \Ič̣imo\i). The word is glossed: in Chech. "купырь лесной (со съедобным корнем)"; in Ing. "свинушка (зонтичное растение)"; in Bacb. by Desheriyev "свинуха (растение)", by Kadagidze "купырь". 5th class in Chech., Ing., 6th class in Bacb.
505|*ħēq-ur-|1336|burdock|ħȫqurg|||    The Chech. form is a diminutive < \I*ħēq-ur-iḳ.\i Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
506|*ꭓāl|1337|stalk (of grass)|ꭓal|||    Obl. base \I*ꭓāli-,\i cf. Chech. \Iꭓēla-;\i cf. also the diminutive \Iꭓēlig\i 'blade (of grass)'. Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
507|*c̣a-ḳ ( ~ -ā-)|1339|arrow|||c̣aḳ|    The stem includes a diminutive *-ḳ (\I*c̣aḳ\i < \I*c̣aH-Vḳ\i). Attested only in Bacb., but having reliable external parallels.
508|*ʔerc̣|1340|reed, cane|erz|||    Obl. base \I*ʔerc̣a-\i (Chech. \Ierza-\i). Cf. also Lev. \Iʔjerz,\i It. \Iʔjerʒa\i id.
509|*pħē|1344|village|pħa||pħe|    Obl. stem \I*pħāna-\i (cf. Chech. \Ipħāna-\i); its vocalism has influenced the Chech. direct stem. 4th class in Chech., 6th class in Bacb.
510|*q̇or-Vḳ ( ~ -ō-)|1347|burrow||q̇org||    Attested only in Ing. (with a frequent diminutive *-Vḳ), but having probable external parallels. Nakh > Osset. \Iqorɣ\i / \Iɣorɣä\i 'pit' (Abayev 1973, 311).
511|*lāmV-j|1349|stairs, ladder|lāmi|lɔmi||    6th class in both languages. The Bacb. word for 'stairs, ladder' is \Ilaṗ;\i historically it is rather a reflection of PN \I*laṗa\i 'shed, penthouse' (q.v.) with a semantic contamination of two roots in Bacb.
512|*n(ɦ)aʁV-r|1350|1 lid, cover (of a box, chest) 2 eye-lid|neʁar 1|noʁar 1,2||    3d class in both languages.
513|*mott|1353|1 bed 2 place|mott 1|mott 1|mott 1,2|    Obl. base \I*matti-,\i cf. Chech. \Imetta-,\i Ing. \Imetto.\i Cf. also the derived form \I*matt-iḳ\i > Chech. \Imettig,\i Ing. \Imottig\i (with vowel levelling) 'place'.
514|*(p)sāl|1357|pile, heap|sal|||    Obl. base \Isāla-.\i Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
515|*c̣ā|1358|house, room|c̣a|c̣a|c̣a|    Obl. base \I*c̣ē-ni-,\i cf. Chech. \Ic̣īna-,\i Ing. \Ic̣eno.\i 3d class in all languages.
516|*kaw|1359|gate|kow|kow||    Obl. base \I*kawi-na-\i (cf. Chech. \Ikewna-\i). 3d class in both languages.
517|*q̇aħ|293|1 fumes, stink, stuffy air 2 heat|q̇aħ 1|q̇aħ 2||    Obl. base \I*q̇aħo-,\i cf. Chech. \Iq̇oħa-,\i Ing. \Iq̇aħo.\i 4th class in both languages.
518|*=aḳ-|1368|to fold, make pleats|=ag-|||    Cf. also Chech. \Inog,\i obl. \Inoga-\i 'corner, bend' (an old derivate < \I*w-VnḳV\i = PA \I*bi(r)ḳun\i).
519|*c̣ōm|1370|trunk|c̣om|||    Obl. base \Ic̣ȫma-\i ( < \I*c̣ōmi-\i). Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
520|*sān|963|corner, border, edge|sa|sa|-sã|    Obl. base \I*sānV-,\i cf. Chech. \Isōna-,\i Ing. \Isäno.\i 6th class in both languages. In Bacb. the root is preserved within the compound \Inʕajʔ-sã\i 'external door' (for the first part see \I*nɦeʔ\i 'door').
521|*c̣ɦoṗ ( ~ -ō-)|1372|edge (of weapon); top|||c̣ʕoṗ|    Attested only in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
522|*ḳač ( ~ -ā-)|722|foot, leg (a slighting expression)|||ḳač|    Isolated in Bacb., but having good external parallels.
523|*ḳɦōḳ|1374|pit|ḳag|ḳɔg|ḳʕoḳ|    The obl. stem \I*ḳɦāḳu-\i ( > Chech. \Iḳōga-,\i Ing. \Iḳɔgo\i) influenced the direct base both in Chech. and Ing. (otherwise one would expect \Iḳog\i in both languages). 6th class in all languages.     The same root is present in the PN derivate \I*ḳɦāḳ-ru-n\i 'deep' > Chech. \Iḳorga\i (with preservation of the suffixless stem in \Iḳarg-dan\i 'to deepen'), Ing. \Iḳɔrga,\i Bacb. (with vowel levelling) \Iḳʕoḳrũ.\i
524|*q̇aħe-n|309|bitter|q̇äħa|q̇aħa|q̇aħẽ|    The pure stem \I*q̇aħ-\i is reflected in Chech. \Iq̇aħ-dan,\i Bacb. \Iq̇aħ-dar\i 'to make smth. bitter'.
525|*dʕāʁu|783|1 key 2 lock|dōʁa 1,2|dʕɔʁa 1||    3d class in both languages. Cf. also Shar. \Idɔ̄ʁu,\i Cheb. \Idāʁu,\i Akk. \Idʕōʁō̃\i etc. Cf. also Osset. \Idäɣäl\i 'key' (from some early derivate, not preserved in modern languages), see Abayev 1958, 351.
526|*č̣uḳ|1381|1 door hook 2 ring,chain-link 3 drinking horn,-let|č̣ug 1,2|č̣ug 1,2|č̣uḳ 3|    Cf. also Pharch. \Ič̣ug\i 'door hook'. Obl. base \I*č̣aḳ-ar-\i is seen in Chech. \Ič̣agara-.\i 4th class in Chech. and Ing., 5th class in Bacb. As seen from the various meanings, the basic semantics of the root is 'a hooked or curved object'.
527|*dab(V) ( ~ -ā-,-w-)|1384|a woven basket (for corn or for fishing)|dō|dɔ||    Cf. also Akk. \Idaw(a\i) id. 6th class in both languages.
528|*gōte ( ~ *gētu)|1388|anus|gȫta|||    Taken from the Russian-Chechen dictionary.
529|*ʔanga-laj ( ~-ḳ-)|1390|glass|angali|||    Isolated in Chech., but having possible external parallels (if "glass" <  "window").
530|*ʡur(-iḳ)|1392|hole|ʕürg|ʕurg|ʕür (Matsiyev)|    3d class in Chech., Ing., 4th class in Bacb. The Chech.-Ing. form contains a diminutive *-iḳ.
531|*pꭓo ( ~ -ō)|1394|bottom||pꭓo||    Isolated in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
532|*ʔaħu|1395|1 downwards 2 lower part|oħa- 1|ʕo- 1|aħo 2|    Ing. \Iʕo-\i < \I*ʔoħ-\i with a secondary transfer of the emphatic laryngeal into Anlaut. In Chech. and Ing. the root is basically used as a preverb (it is also used as such in Bacb.); but cf. also Chech. \Ioħara\i 'lower', \Ioħanē\i '(place of) descent'.
533|*larṭ ( ~ -ā-)|1396|foundation|lard|lard||    4th class in both languages.
534|*bʡab ( ~ -w)|1398|tower|bʕow|wʕow||    Obl. base \I*bʕawi-na-\i (Chech. \Ibʕäwna-,\i Ing. \Iwʕowno\i). 4th class in both languages.
535|*maʡa-r, *mʡā-ra|1399|1 fork 2 fishing-rod 3 hook|maʕar,mʕāra 1,2|mʕara 2,3||    6th class in both languages. The form \Imʕāra\i is obviously a contraction < \I*maʕara.\i
536|*ʁoč̣|1400|stick|ʁaž|ʁaž / ʁaǯ|ʁoč̣|    The PN paradigm can be reconstructed as \I*ʁoč̣,\i \I*ʁač̣u-\i (in Chech. and Ing. the oblique base superseded the direct one); for the obl. \I*ʁač̣u-\i cf. Chech. \Iʁoža-.\i Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Iʁaž,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Iʁač:\i 'stick'. 4th class in all languages.
537|*č̣ar-iḳ(en)|1402|1 transverse, ceiling beam 2 short stick|č̣erg 1|č̣arga 1|č̣arḳẽ 2|    The root contains a usual diminutive suffix (*-iḳ); Bacb. and Ing. reflect a secondary derivate in *-en. 3d class in Chech. and Bacb., 4th class in Ing.
538|*gāra|1404|1 a piece of cloven log 2 block|gāra|gar||    3d class in both languages.
539|*duq̇V|1406|log, beam|duq̇ū|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
540|*c̣ur ( ~ -ū-)|1407|arrow|||c̣ur|    Isolated in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
541|*ʔu|1410|1 board 2 wooden floor|u 1|uj 2||    The Ing. form is actually a former plural (\I*ʔu-bi\i 'boards'). The original oblique stem \I*ʔulV-\i is seen in the Ing. derivate \Iul-g\i 'small board, plank' (both in Ing. and Chech. it was superseded by a more recent \I*ʔu-ne-,\i cf. Chech. \Iüna-,\i Ing. \Iujno\i). 3d class in Chech. and Ing.
542|*laṗa|1415|shed; peak of cap|laba|laba||    4th class in both languages.
543|*ʔaħ-|1420|to grind|aħ-|aħ-|aħ-|    A terminative verbal stem with no class markers. There are two archaic derivates:     1) PN \I*ħēr\i (obl. \I*ħāri-,\i sometimes passing to dir.) "mill": Chech. \Iħer\i (\Iħēra-\i) 'mill' (cf. also \Ika-ħar\i 'hand-mill', \Iħar-ꭓō\i 'miller'); Ing. \Iħajra\i (erg. \Iħäro\i) 'mill' (cf. also \Ikel-ħar\i 'hand-mill'); Bacb. \Iħajrĭ,\i \Iħajră\i 'mill'. 4th class in all languages.     2) PN \I*ħāru\i 'meal, flour': Ing. \Iħɔr,\i Bacb. \Iħajrŭ,\i \Iħajrĭ\i (3d class in Ing., 4th class in Bacb.).
544|*ḳ́ebu ( ~-ē-,-w-)|1429|granary|č̣ȫ|ḳe||    6th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing. Obl. base \I*ḳ́ebu-na-\i (Chech. \Ič̣ȫna-,\i Ing. \Iḳeno\i). Cf. also Lev. \Ič̣ȫ,\i Cheb. \Ič̣wã.\i
545|*c(V)ʁar ( ~ -ꭓ-)|1431|penthouse|cꭓar|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
546|*ʒʡāra|1434|1 wattle-fence 2 wattle|zʕāra 1|zʕar 1|zar 2|    4th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
547|*baǯV-l (~-o-,-č̣-)|1435|stall, horse-stall|božal|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
548|*c̣Vr-ḳāḳi|332|thaw|c̣eḳega (ICR)|c̣erḳäga||    A compound noun; the first part probably goes back to the EC root for 'ice, turn to ice'. The second part is not quite clear (cf. PN \I*ḳāḳi\i 'coals, live coals'?).
549|*ꭓāra|545|1 tree-hollow 2 grain-tub made of a hollowed trunk|ꭓāra|ꭓara||    4th class in both languages.
550|*mac̣-ri-n|1440|sweet|merza|merza|mac̣rĩ|    Cf. also Bacb. \Imac̣ar-dar\i ( = Chech. \Imarz-dan\i)  'to sweeten'; Chech. Cheb. \Imarzĩ,\i Shar. \Imerʒĩ\i etc. 'sweet'.     A derivate of the same stem is PN \I*moc̣\i (obl. base \I*mac̣i-\i) 'honey': Chech. \Imoz\i (\Imeza-\i), Ing. \Imoz\i / \Imoʒ\i (\Imezo\i), Bacb. \Imoc̣\i (\Imac̣i-\i) (3d class in all languages). A regular reflex of the old PEC derivate \I*hwmĭʒ̲ū\i would be PN \I*ʡoṭṭ\i (\I*ʡaṭṭ\i), so it is obvious that the nominal stem was rebuilt on the analogy with the adjective 'sweet'.
551|*ḳoncV- ( ~ -ō-)|1441|garlic|ḳoncerg|||    The Chech. form is taken from Карасаев-Мациев 1978, where it is qualified as 'archaic dialectal'.
552|*ꭓōꭓ|1442|onion|ꭓoꭓ|ꭓoꭓ||    Obl. base \I*ꭓōꭓa-\i (Chech. \Iꭓōꭓa-\i).
553|*šārč|1443|sedge|šač|šarš||    The reconstruction is highly tentative, because the Chech. and Ing. forms correspond badly to each other. It is not clear why Chech. lost -r-, and why in Ing. -č > -š. 4th class in both languages.
554|*dātti-n|1444|butter|dätta|dätta|dattẽ|    3d class in all languages. Final *-n (historically a suffix) is reflected in the Bacb. nasalisation and in the Chech. obl. stem (\Idättana-\i).
555|*šim|1447|udder|šin|šim|šĩ|    Obl. base \I*šima-\i / \I*šam-ar-\i (cf. Chech. \Išina-,\i Ing. \Išamaro;\i the variant \I*šamar-\i is probably more archaic and demonstrates the PN Ablaut). 6th class in all languages.
556|*nalꭓ[o]|1449|butter|nalꭓa|nalꭓa||    Obl. base \I*nalꭓe-\i (Chech. \Inelꭓa-,\i Ing. \Inalꭓo\i). For final *-o cf. Chech. Shar. \Inolꭓo\i (but Cheb. \Inalꭓa\i points rather to *-a). 5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing.
557|*ʔōc̣- / *ʔēbc̣-|1451|1 to milk 2 to pull; to sip, to smoke|ōz-a|oz-a|oc̣-ar|    For the durative \I*ʔē-b-c̣-\i cf. Chech. \Iīz-a,\i Ing. \Iuwz-a,\i Bacb. \Iebc̣-ar\i / \Ieṗc̣-ar.\i
558|*ʡām|1452|lake, pond, pool|ʕam|ʕam|ʕam|    Obl. base \I*ʡāme-/*ʡāmo-\i (Chech. \Iʕōma-/\i (Uslar) \Iʕēmi-,\i Ing. \Iʕamo\i). 6th class in all languages.
559|*šār|1453|buttermilk|šar|šar|šar|    Obl. base \I*šāre-\i (Chech. \Išēra-,\i Ing. \Išaro\i). Cf. also Chech. Pharch. \Išār\i id. 3d class in Chech. and Ing., 5th class in Bacb.
560|*ṭune|1454|1 dampness, moistness 2 raw, damp, moist|ṭüna 2|ṭuna-l 1|ṭwĩ 1|    The pure stem is preserved in Bacb. (cf. also Chech. \Iṭun-dan\i 'to moisten' = Bacb. \Iṭwin-od-dar\i); the Chech. adjective goes back to \I*ṭune-n\i (cf. in Uslar's recording \Iṭüniŋ;\i cf. also Cheb. \Iṭunĩ,\i Shar. \Iṭujnĩ,\i Khild. \Iṭwinĩ\i etc.).
561|*mac̣-ru|1456|whey, buttermilk|morza|morz|mac̣rŏ|    Cf. also Chech. Cheb. \Imarzu,\i Khild. \Imorʒŭ,\i It. \Imorʒu,\i Shar. \Imorʒo,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Imworc:.\i 3d class in all languages.
562|*ʔaꭓḳV|369|summer|äꭓkē|aꭓka|ꭓḳo|    Short vowel reconstructed because of reduction in Bacbi. Ing. \Iaꭓka\i = Chech. \Iäꭓka\i 'in summer' (Chech. \Iäꭓkē\i is a suffixed form).         The meaning "summer" is obviously secondary. The older meaning 'year' is still preserved in the PN compound \I*sṭā-ꭓḳŭ\i 'last year' > Chech. \Istoꭓka,\i Ing. \Isɔꭓk,\i Bacb. \Isṭaŭꭓḳŭ\i (for the etymology of the first part see PEC \I*śwăjV\i).
563|*lo ( ~ -ō)|1457|yeast, leaven||lo||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
564|*=at-|1458|to curdle, coagulate|=at-|=at-|l-at-|
565|*b(ɦ)art|1459|1 lips, mouth 2 kiss|bart|bart||    Obl. base \I*barte-\i (Chech. \Iberta-,\i Ing. \Ibarto\i). Traces of the original meaning "top" can be seen in derivates: PN \I*bart-iḳ\i "mouth (of a sack or vessel); top (of a boot)" (Chech., Ing. \Ibertig\i); \I*barte-l\i (adv.) "face down" (Chech. \Ibertal,\i Ing. \Ibartal\i).
566|*nošV / *mošV (~-ō-)|374|1 green, unripe 2 to grow overripe|noš-dala 2|moša 1||    The Chech. compound verb means actually "to stop (\Id-āla\i) being unripe)" = "to grow ripe, overripe"; cf. the equivalent Ing. \Imoš-dala\i "to become foul, rotten".
567|*gorV-mV (~-u-,-V̄-)|379|a wheel for hitching the plough|gurma|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
568|*ḳVwV (~ḳ́-,-b-)|1462|porridge made of chopped corn||ḳo||    Attested only in Ing., thus the PN reconstruction is tentative (several different protoforms are possible).
569|*l-ēṭ-|1693|to trickle, drip|lēd-|||    The verb \Ilēd-\i is attested only in Chech. The same root (with a usual Ablaut *a/*ē) can be perhaps discovered in PN \I*k-aṭ-\i 'to mourn, bemoan' (Chech., Ing. \Ikad-,\i Bacb. \Ikaṭ-\i) - if the original meaning is 'to pour, drop (tears)'.     A reduplicated stem \I*ṭaṭ-am\i 'drop' is reflected in Chech. \Iṭadam,\i Ing. \Iṭadam.\i
570|*kādu (~-b-,-g-)|1463|malt|ko|||    The Chech. word is taken from Карасаев-Мациев 1978; vowel length and correspondences in other Nakh languages are unknown, thus the PN reconstruction is provisional (\I*kādu\i is one of several possibilities).
571|*cu|1465|1 oat flour 2 flour made from roasted corn|cu|cu|cu|    For short *ŭ cf. Chech. dat. \Icu-na.\i 5/6th class in Chech., 5th class in Ing., 6th class in Bacb.
572|*čuṭa|1466|flat cake stuffed with force-meat|čuda|||
573|*lujsṭ|1468|1 sheep's dung 2 thick, dense|lüst 1, lüsta 2|lista 2|jupsṭĩ 2|    The noun \I*lujsṭ\i must have meant 'thick, clayish substance' (whence 'dung' in Chech.). The Bacb. form is interesting, because it demonstrates the original *-j- which had been shifted to Anlaut (\I*lujsṭi-n\i > \I*ljuwsṭi-n\i > \Ijupsṭĩ\i); another trace of PN *-j- here is the Chech. vowel -ü- in the direct stem \Ilüst.\i     Abayev (1973, 57-58) considers the Nakh adjective to be borrowed from Osset. \Ilɨst(äg\i) / \Ilist(äg\i) 'small, thin'. This is hardly the case because of the non-trivial phonetic structure of the Nakh root (the semantic side also raises doubts).
574|*ʔol-eḳ ( ~ ɦ-)|1470|cake, cookie|ölg|olg||    The word contains a common Nakh diminutive suffix.
575|*kurʒi (~-ō-,-e)|1473|a k. of dumplings|kürza|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
576|*šura|1474|milk|šura|šura|šur|    4th class in all languages.

581|*doꭓḳV ( ~ -ō-)|1482|belt, girdle|döꭓka|ṭeꭓkar|duꭓḳã|    3d class in all languages. The vocalism is somewhat unclear (in particular, Bacb. -u- is unclear); ṭ- in Ing. is a result of early assimilation (\I*doꭓḳV-\i > \I*ṭoꭓḳV-\i). The word has a *-n-suffix in Bacb. and a -r-suffix in Ing. (reflecting the oblique base, cf. Chech. \Idöꭓkara-\i). Cf. also Chech. Cheb. \Idjeꭓku,\i Khild. \Iṭjoꭓkŭ\i etc.
582|*muʔVl ( ~ -o-,-V̄-)|1485|a spindle-thread twisted into one strand||muʔal||    Attested only in Ing., with a possible Lak. parallel.

584|*kōč̣el-iḳ ( ~ -ǯ-)|1489|stick with a hook; hook, gaff|kȫžalg|kožolg||    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. In the Russ.-Chech. dictionary the  Chech. word is glossed as \Ikožalg;\i in the Russ.-Chech.-Ing. dictionary - as  \Ikožolg.\i     The word has an *-l-suffix (with a following diminutive). The suffixless  stem is probably reflexed in Chech. \Iḳāža\i 'hinge, door-hinge' (with an  assimilation ḳ- < k-, as in some other EC languages).
585|*ḳāṭi-n|413|soft|ḳēda|ḳäda|ḳaṭẽ|    Cf. also Cheb. \Iḳādẽ,\i Akk. \Iḳēdã\i etc. The pure stem is preserved in Chech. \Iḳad-dan,\i Bacb. \Iḳaṭ-dar\i 'to soften'.
586|*ṭʡV-|1491|chain|ṭq̇ē|||    Attested only in Chech., thus there are several possible PN reconstructions (with *-j-,-w-,-b-,-d-,-g-).
587|*hoc̣ ( ~ -ʒ)|1493|ring, hoop|hoz|||    Attested only in Chech.; Ing. \Iʁoz\i id. is quite a different root (see PEC \I*GV̆nVc̣a\i).

596|*ʡabiḳ|1520|spoon|ʕajg|ʕag|ʕabiḳ|    6th class in all languages. Cf. also Pharch. \Iʕabəḳ\i (either reflecting an early assimilation > \I*ʡāṗiḳ\i or a loan from Andian languages).
597|*ħāstV-m|1524|nail, peg|ħostam|ħastam||    Cf. also Chech. Lev. \Iħōastam,\i Cheb. \Iħāstom,\i Ing. (Imnaishvili) \Iħāstam.\i 6th class in both languages.

599|*ʔurs|1529|knife|urs|urs||    Cf. also Shar., Khild. etc. \Iurs\i id. 3d class in both languages. The Ablaut stem \I*ʔarsV-\i is preserved in Chech. plur. \Iarsa-š.\i

601|*ḳ́ăṭu|1531|1 big scissors 2 scissors for shearing sheep|č̣oda 2|ḳod 1|q̇ajṭŭ 2|    Initial uvular in Bacb. is unclear; otherwise correspondences are regular.
602|*ḳuṭal|1534|1 big brass water jar 2 small jar|ḳudal|ḳudal|ḳuṭal|    4th class in all languages. Since the word is undoubtedly common Nakh and has probable EC parallels, Georg. \Iḳuṭali\i 'small jar' must be regarded as a Nakh loanword.
603|*kudVrV ( ~ -ū-)|1535|earthenware churn|kǖra|kuwra||    4th class in Chech. and Ing. Since there are no Bacb. parallels, the medial consonant can be reconstructed as *-d-, *-b-, *-g- or *-w-; external evidence suggests *-d-.
604|*giṗe ( ~ -o)|1539|earthenware jar with a wide mouth|giba|giba||    4th class in both languages. Cf. also Pharch. \Igiba\i 'big earthenware vessel'.
605|*c̣uṗ-|660|to suck|c̣ub-dan||c̣uṗ-dar|    A compound verb (cf. also Bacb. \Ic̣uṗ-aλar\i) id., with the nominal component \I*c̣uṗ\i "sucking".
606|*kit|1548|wineskin, leather sack|kit|kit|kit|    Obl. base \I*kĭte-\i (Chech. \Ikita-,\i Ing. \Ikito\i); the more archaic stem \I*kătV-\i is preserved in the plural form \I*kat-bV(š\i) > Chech. \Ikattaš,\i Bacb. \Ikatbi.\i 3d class in Chech. and Bacb., 4th class in Ing.
607|*ṭāqe|1549|1 tub (for cheese brine) 2 tub|ṭēqa 1|ṭaqa 1||    3d class in both languages. Cf. also the Ing. obl. base \Iṭäqo\i ( < \I*ṭāqi-\i).
608|*ḳoc̣-ol ( ~ -ō-)|1551|plait|||ḳoc̣ol|    Attested only in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.

611|*q̇ul-eḳ ( ~ -ū-)|1558|churn|q̇ülg|q̇ulg||    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. The word contains a frequent diminutive suffix *-(e)ḳ.
612|*dašVb|1563|gold|deši|došuw||    3d class in both languages. Cf. also Chech. (Uslar) \Idešī,\i (Imnaishvili) \Idešĳ\i id.
613|*daš|1565|lead|daš|daš||    Obl. stem \I*dašu-\i (Chech. \Idoša-,\i Ing. \Idašo\i with vowel levelling). 3d class in both languages.
614|*ṭaw ( ~ -ā-)|1567|branch|||ṭaw|    Attested only in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
615|*ḳaj ( ~ -ā-)|1569|handle (of a cauldron, bucket)|ḳaj|ḳaj||    3d class in both languages. Because there is no Bacb. parallel, several reconstructions are possible (with *-b-, *-d-, *-g-, *-j- or *-w-); *-j is chosen because of external evidence.
616|*=aḳ- / *=ēḳ-|1573|to embroider|=ag-|=ag-||    The Ablaut grade \I*-ēḳ-\i is seen in Chech. \It-ēg-\i 'to embroider; to sew' (term.).

619|*jeꭓḳ|1581|comb|jeꭓk|jaꭓk|jeꭓḳ|    4th class in all languages. The vowel -a- in Ing. is due to vowel levelling, cf. the PN obl. base \I*ʔaꭓḳ-ar-\i (Chech. \Iaꭓkara-,\i Ing. \Iaꭓkaro,\i Bacb. \Iaꭓḳari-\i). Cf. also Chech. Cheb., Khild. etc. \Ijeꭓk,\i Shar., Itumk. \Ijerk.\i
620|*ṭōl-iḳ|1582|1 rags 2 a k. of rough felt cloak|ṭǖlig 1||ṭoliḳ 2|    4th class in Chech., 5th class in Bacb. The word contains the common Nakh diminutive *-iḳ.

622|*māša|1586|1 home-spun cloth 2 woolen cloth 3 cobweb|māša|maša|māšĕ, maš|    6th class in all languages. Obl. base \I*māši-\i (cf. Ing. \Imäšo\i).

628|*ʡ-iṭṭ- / *ʡ-oṭṭ-|574|to prick, stick in, insert|ʕitt- / ʕott-|ʕott-|ħoṭṭ- (Desheriyev)|    The root is used only with the laryngeal preverbs *ʡ- / *ħ-, and demonstrates a case of the rare PN Ablaut *i (dur.) / *o (term.).
629|*č̣inḳ|1605|weir, dam|č̣ing|||    Attested only in Chech., with probable Lezg. parallels.
630|*ʔālV-j|1606|ravine||äli||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
631|*gudura|1607|1 cage, frame; trap 2 plough-beam 3 part of loom|gūra 1|guwra 2|gudur 3|    The precise meaning in Bacb. is "big wooden card in a loom". 6th class in all languages. A derivate of the same root is Chech. \Igǖrig\i ( < \I*gudur-iḳ\i) 'wooden block'.     It is interesting to note Georg. \Igodori\i 'a big cylinder-shaped basket' - apparently borrowed from Nakh. The same source (possibly through Georg.) has Osset. \Igodorä\i 'basket for grain' (see Abayev 1958, 522).
632|*=aħ-|1611|to carry, bear|=aħ-|=aħ-|=aħ-|    Cf. also PN \I*ħo-,\i the present / imperative stem of the same verb (Chech., Ing. \Iħo,\i Bacb. \Iħo-\i).
633|*moħ|1612|pack, burden|moħ|muħ|muħ / moħ|    6th class in all languages. In Bacb. \Imoħ\i is Matsiyev's notation, \Imuħ\i - the notation of Kadagidze. Obl. base \I*maħu-\i (cf. Chech. \Imoħa-,\i pl. \I*maħ(b)i-š\i > Chech. \Imaħħaš,\i Ing. \Imowħaš,\i Bacb. \Imaħiš\i). The Ing. obl. base \Imiħo\i is an innovation (\Imiħ\i < \I*muħi-\i with vowel levelling after the direct base).
634|*dače-ḳ(a)|1613|1 wood, firewood 2 a small fragment of a branch|dečig 1|daꭓča 1|dačꭓar 2 (Imnaishvili)|    3d class in Chech. and Ing. (in Chech. 4th class with the meaning 'wood (material)'). Ing. -ꭓč- and Bacb. -čꭓ- in this case go back to *-č-(V)ḳ- (preserved in Chech. as -čig).
635|*ʔāsso|1615|strap, belt; stripe|āsa|ɔsa|assŏ|    4th class in all languages (but 6th class in Ing. with the meaning 'stripe'). Obl. stem \I*ʔāsi-\i (Ing. \Iäso,\i Bacb. pl. \Iase-rč\i). In Bacb. \Iassŏ\i is the record of Imnaishvili; Matsiyev and Kadagidze have -s- (probably a misspelling). Cf. also Cheb. \Iāso,\i Shar. \Iōso,\i Khild. \Iōsŏ,\i Ved., Itumk. \Iāsa.\i
636|*m(ɦ)uš|1617|string, rope|muš|muš||    6th class in both languages. Obl. stem \I*muše-\i (Chech. \Imüša-,\i Ing. \Imušo\i).

638|*ʔurꭓ ( ~ -ū-)|1620|reins|urꭓ|urꭓ|urꭓ (Imnaishvili)|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*ʔurꭓe-\i ( ~ -ū-), cf. Chech. \Iürꭓa-,\i Ing. \Iurꭓo\i (the Ablaut grade \I*ʔarꭓV-\i is also present in Chech. pl. \Iarꭓaš\i).

642|*ɦāꭓḳ́i > *ɦāhḳ́i|1624|iron|ēčig|äšk|ʕajhḳĭ|    3d class in all languages. The word has a complicated phonetic history. The original form \I*ɦāꭓḳi\i was already in PN transformed (through assimilation) into \I*ɦāhḳ́i,\i which is directly reflected in Bacb. \Iʕajhḳĭ\i (notation of Kadagidze; Matsiyev has \Iajħḳ,\i and Desheriyev - \Iʕajħḳ\i). In Checheno-Ingush the word obtained a common diminutive suffix *-ḳ: \I*ɦāhḳ́i-ḳ,\i with further (regular) palatalisation > \I*ʔāč̣iḳ.\i This form, with assimilation and reduction, yielded Chech. \Iēčig\i (obl. \Iäčka-\i < \I*ʔāčiḳe-\i) and Ing. \Iäšk.\i
643|*kōč̣ ( ~ -ǯ)|1628|pack-saddle|kož|kož||    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*kōč̣e-\i ( ~ -ǯ-), cf. Chech. \Ikȫža-,\i Ing. \Ikožo.\i

645|*ǯʡormak ( ~ -a-)|1630|strap, thong|žʕormak|||    The word also means 'a piece of leather wherein the stone is put (a detail of the sling)'. It is attested only in Chech., but has probable parallels in EC languages.
646|*qaw|628|arable land, field|qa|qa|qaw|    Obl. base \I*qawe-\i (cf. Chech. \Iqe-,\i Ing. \Iqajwa\i). 3d class in all languages.
647|*ʔārʁ(a) ( ~ ʕ-)|1633|a low mountain ridge|raʁ|arʁa||    4th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing. Obl. base \I*ʔārʁe-\i (Chech. \Irēʁa-\i).     Nakh forms (at least Chech. \Iraʁ\i) may be actually borrowed from Iranian, cf. Osset. \Iraʁ\i 'mountain ridge' < \I*rāga-\i (Pers. \Irāɣ\i etc.), see Abayev 1973, 344. But most probably there was a merger of the genuine root and the Iranian loan.
648|*ʔāsṭi(n)|1635|1 hoe, mattock 2 instrument for planing wood|ästa 1,2|äst 2|asṭĩ 2|    4th class in all languages. Cf. also Cheb. \Iāsti,\i Lev. \Iǟsti,\i Shar. \Iēsti\i etc.
649|*gōtan|1636|plough|gōta|gota||    Obl. base \I*gōtana-\i (cf. Chech. \Igōtana-\i). Bacb. \Igutan\i id. has an aberrant vowel and is obviously borrowed from Georgian (Georg. \Igutani\i 'plough').
650|*moq|1637|1 harrow 2 plough|meqa 1|maqa 1|moq 2|    The attested forms (Bacb. is cited from Matsiyev's dictionary) reflect a normal PN paradigm \I*moq,\i \I*maqe-,\i with shift of the obl. base to direct in Chech. and Ing. 6th class in all languages.     Nakh > Osset. \Imäq(q)ī\i 'network upon which hay is being stacked' (see Abayev 1973, 95).
651|*-lꭓa-na|641|yesterday|selꭓana|selꭓan||    PN \I*(p)sa-lꭓEna\i is opposed to \I*si-psara\i 'yesterday night', so the component \I*-lꭓEna\i means either 'day' or 'yesterday' (in general). \I-lꭓE-\i here may be contracted from \I*dVlꭓE-,\i which would be a regular correspondence for Av. \Inoƛ:\i and Darg. \I*duk:i\i / \I*dak:.\i The etymology of \I*(p)sa-\i ( < \I*(p)sarV-\i) see under \I*śwĔrV.\i     In PN there also exists a root \I*tꭓa\i 'today' (Chech. \Itaꭓa-na,\i Ing. \Itaꭓa-n\i  'today' as a secondary development < \I*tꭓa-na,\i Chech. \Itꭓo-wsa,\i Ing. \Itꭓowsara\i  'tonight', Bacb. \Itꭓa\i 'today', \Itꭓa-bus\i 'yesterday night' [ = Chech. \Itꭓowsa],\i  \Itꭓujnŏ\i 'in the daytime'). This may well be an early development < \I*lꭓa\i (cf.  an analogous phenomenon in the 1st p. pl. pronoun \I*tꭓo\i).
652|*duq̇|1638|yoke|duq̇|duq̇|duq̇|    3d class in all languages. Obl. base \I*duq̇a-\i (Chech. \Iduq̇a-,\i Ing. \Iduq̇o\i id.); the Ablaut stem \I*daq̇-\i is preserved in plural: Chech. \Idaq̇q̇a-,\i Ing. \Idowq̇a-\i < \I*daq̇-bV-.\i

655|*ħaq- / *ħēq-|1644|to rub, smear; to sweep|ħaq- / ħēq-|ħaq- / ħeq-|ħaq- / ħeq-|    The root demonstrates the usual PN Ablaut (term. -a-, dur. -ē-). In PN this is most probably a result of merging two PEC roots (\I*=Vwq̲V\i and \I*HărqV\i).
656|*nŏꭓ|1646|plough|noꭓ|nuꭓ||    3d class in both languages. Obl. base \I*naꭓo-rV-\i (Chech. \Inaꭓara-,\i Ing. \Inoꭓaro\i).
657|*=āc-|662|1 to mow 2 to work hard, be exploited|=āc- 2|=ac- 2|=ac- 1|    A PN derivate is \I*cēl\i 'hoe' ( < *'sickle, scythe'), reflected in Chech. \Icel\i (\Icēla-\i), Ing. \Icel;\i however, Bacb. \Icel\i 'scythe' is rather to be considered a loan from Georg. \Iceli\i 'scythe'.
658|*ko(w)|1650|a bunch of wheat mown by one sweep of a sickle|ko|||    Obl. base \Iko-na-.\i Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
659|*ʔēs|1652|1 a bundle of 3 sheaves 2 a bundle of 4 sheaves|ös|es||    4th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*ʔēsu-\i (Chech. \Iȫsa-,\i Ing. \Ieso\i); the vowel ö in the Chech. direct base is a result of later vowel levelling.
660|*lāʒi ( ~ -c̣-)|1653|a heap of wheat sheaves|lēza|läza||    4th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing.
661|*ꭓōla|1655|haystack|ꭓōla|ꭓol||    3d class in Chech., 6th class in Ing.
662|*ʁāma|1656|1 haystack 2 haycock|ʁāma 1|ʁama 2||    4th class in both languages.
663|*ħett ( ~ -ē-,-ṭṭ)|1657|threshing-floor|ħätt|ħett||    4th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing. Obl. base \I*ħatte-rV-\i (~-ā-,-ṭṭ-), cf. Chech. \Iħättara-,\i Ing. \Iħattaro.\i
664|*ʔārŁ-|1658|to thresh|ār-|ard-|arl-|    In Bacb. arl- is Kadagidze's notation; Matsiyev has arλ-. A direct derivate from this verbal stem is PN \I*ʔārŁV:\i Chech. \Iēra\i 'threshing-floor; grain lying upon it', Ing. \Iɔrda-l\i 'sheaves ready for threshing; cattle working on the threshing-floor'.
665|*b(ɦ)al-|1663|hill||balam||    Attested only in Ing. (with a frequent suffix -Vm), but having probable external parallels.
666|*laʔ ( ~ -ā-,-ʕ)|1664|mountain pass|||laʔ (Matsiyev)|    Attested only in Bacb., with probable external parallels.
667|*bōḳ|1669|lump, excrescence|bog|bog||    Obl. stem \I*bōḳa-\i (Chech. \Ibōga-\i) / \I*bōḳi-\i (Ing. \Ibego\i). 4th class in both languages.
668|*ʡadurV|1675|mountain stream (after rain or thawing)|ʕowr-aš|||    The Chech. form is a pluralis tantum. The reconstruction is tentative (without Bacb. it is impossible to establish whether PN had here *-d-, *-b-, *-g- or *-w-, as well as the precise PN vowel quality and quantity).
669|*-Vḳ|2277|1 a diminutive suffix 2 deverbative nominal and adjective substantivator|-Vg 1, -rg, -nig 2|-Vg, -lg 1|-Vḳ 1, -ri-ḳ  2|    An extremely productive common Nakh suffix (usually diminutive, but in some cases neutralized).
670|*for-d ( ~-ṭ)|1679|sea|hord|ford||    6th class in both languages. Abayev (1,485-486) thinks that the Nakh forms are borrowed from Ossetian (\Ifūrd\i / \Iford\i 'big river, sea'). But the Ossetian word has no Iranian or IE etymology (see Abayev ibid.), whereas the NC etymology of the Nakh word ( = Av. \Iraλád\i etc.) is quite clear - therefore it is obvious that the Ossetian word is borrowed from Nakh.
671|*ħāst ( ~ -ṭ)|1680|spring|ħast|ħast||    Obl. base \I*ħāstu-\i (cf. Chech. \Iħosta-;\i in Ing. \Iħasto\i with vowel levelling). 3d class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. For vowel length cf. the Pharch. form \Iħāst.\i
672|*stiḳe-l (~sṭ-)|1683|sky|stigal|sigale||    4th class in both languages.
673|*ma|2272|a prohibitive particle ("do not...")|ma|ma|ma|
674|*č̣ič̣ ( ~ -ǯ)|1684|amulet (stone)|č̣iž|||    Cf. perhaps also Chech. \Ič̣ižarʁa,\i Ing. \Ič̣inžarʁa\i 'elder-berry'.
675|*tꭓi|1694|1 dew 2 hoar-frost|tꭓi 1|tꭓi-r 1|tꭓi-r 2|    3d class in all languages. Ing. and Bacb. reflect a suffixed form \I*tꭓi-r.\i
676|*law|1699|snow|lō|lɔ|law|    3d class in all languages. Obl. base \I*lawV-\i (Chech. \Ilaj-,\i Ing. \Ilajwo\i). Cf. also Lev. \Ilwō,\i Akk. \Ilaw\i id.
677|*jīs|1700|hoar-frost|jis|jis||    4th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*ʔāse-rV-\i (Chech. \Iēsara-,\i Ing. \Iasaro\i).
678|*sa|1708|1 light; eye-sight 2 dawn 3 to dawn|sa 1|sa-ꭓila 3|sa-ꭓiλno 2|    3d class in Chech. Obl. base \I*si-\i (cf. Chech. \Isi-n,\i dat. \Isi-na\i).
679|*sṭab(ʡ)V / *bʡastV|1709|1 autumn 2 spring|bʕästē 2|bʕästi 2|sṭabo 1|    The Chech.-Ing. form is metathesized and has a *-jV-suffix (without it cf. Chech. \Ibʕästa\i 'in spring'). Vowel length is not clear.
680|*doħa|1710|spring|||doħa|
681|*ʡa|1711|winter|ʕa|ʕa|ʕa|    3d class in all languages. Obl. base \I*ʕane-\i (cf. Chech. \Iʕäna-,\i Ing. \Iʕano\i). Cf. also Akk., Pharch. \Iʕa.\i
682|*ʡūq̇V|1713|morning twilight|ʕǖq̇ē|ʕüjq̇ē||    4th class in both languages. The Chech. and Ing. forms contain a *-jV-suffix (with another suffixation cf. Chech. \Iʕǖq̇a-na\i 'before dawn').
683|*ʡūrV|1715|morning|ʕǖrē|ʕujra|ʕur-dna|    4th class in all languages. The Nakh languages reflect two forms: \I*ʕūrV-jV\i (Chech. \Iʕǖrē,\i Ing. \Iʕujra,\i Bacb. (Desheriyev) \Iʕĳre\i) and a suffixed form \I*ʕūr-dV\i (Bacb. \Iʕur-dna\i 'morning', \Iʕur-dẽ\i 'in the morning', \Iʕur-d-lũ\i 'morning (adj.)'; Chech. \Iʕurrē\i 'in the morning' = Bacb. \Iʕurdẽ\i).
684|*hin-ca / *hin-ʒa|1718|now|hinca|hanz|inc|    Cf. also Lev., Shar., Khild. \Ihinca\i id.
685|*bʡo|1720|troops, army|bʕo|bʕu|bʕö (Matsiyev)|    5th class in Chech., 5/6th class in Ing., 6th class in Bacb. Obl. base \I*bʡa-\i (cf. Chech. dat. \Ibʕa-na,\i Ing. erg. \Ibʕe-wo\i). Cf. also a suffixed form in Bacb.: Bacb. \Ibuħ\i ( < \I*bʕo-ħu\i) 'war, quarrel'.
686|*baŁ- ( ~ -l-)|1722|1 shoulder 2 shoulders|bel-š 1|bel-až 1|bali 2|    4th class in Chech., Ing., 3d class in Bacb. The Bacb. form is attested only in Kadagidze's dictionary, thus in PN both *-Ł- and *-l- are possible. The Chech.-Ing. form (cf. also Pharch. \Ibeləž,\i Cheb. \Ibališ,\i Shar. \I beliš\i etc.) is an historical plural. Another suffixed form (built from the same root) is \I*bal-Vm\i > Chech. \Ibolam\i 'shoulder (from neck to arm), Ing. \Ibalam\i 'shoulder'.
687|*čabu ( ~ -w-)|1725|wound|čow|čow||    Cf. also Chech. (in Uslar's notation) \Ičauw\i id. 4th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*čabu-ne-\i ( ~ -w-), cf. Chech. \Ičewna-,\i Ing. \Ičowno.\i
688|*t-ōꭓ-|1726|to beat, hit|tōꭓ-|toꭓ-|toꭓ-|    The stem \I*t-ōꭓ-\i is terminative; the durative counterpart \I*t-ē-b-ꭓ-\i is preserved in Bacb. \Itepꭓ-.\i An old Ablaut stem \I*-ārꭓ-\i with another preverb (*d-) is probably reflected in Chech. \Idarꭓ-ō\i 'wounded (person)' (the semantic correlation 'to hit' - 'to wound' is quite usual in NC languages).
689|*=ōꭓ- / *=ēꭓ-|1727|to be destroyed, damaged|=ōꭓ-|=oꭓ-|=oꭓ-|    The durative stem \I*=ēꭓ-\i (with regular Ablaut) is preserved only in Bacb. \I=eꭓ-.\i
690|*host ( ~ f-,-ṭ)|1728|mark (on cattle's ear)|host|fost||    3d class in both languages.
691|*mʡic̣- ( ~ -ʕ-,-ʒ-)|512|snout||mʕiz-arg||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
692|*dol ( ~ -Ł)|1731|cubit|dol|dol|dol|    3d class in all languages. The Bacb. word is attested only in Kadagidze's notation, thus both *-l and *-Ł are possible in PN.
693|*šo|1732|span|ša|šu|še|    4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing., 3d class in Bacb. We must reconstruct two variants for PN: \I*še\i (reflected in Bacb.) and \I*šo\i ( > Ing. \Išu\i). The vowel of the obl. base \I*ša-ni-\i ( > Chech. \Iše-n\i) in Chech. had influenced the direct base (instead of \Išo\i it became \Iša\i). The variation \I*šo\i / \I*še\i in PN perhaps should be explained by a special development of early PN \I*šʷe\i ( < PEC \I*č̣wimħV\i).
694|*doš|1734|word|doš|doš|doš|    3d class in all languages. Obl. stem \I*daši-,\i cf. Chech. \Ideša-,\i Ing. \Idešo,\i Bacb. plur. \Idaš-ni\i ( = Chech. \Ideš-na-š\i).
695|*moq ( ~ -ō-)|1735|song|||moq|    Isolated in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
696|*ʔāc̣ ( ~ ɦ-, -ʒ)|1737|voice, sound|az|ɔz||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*ʔāc̣u-\i (Chech. \Iōza-,\i Ing. \Iɔzo\i), whence secondarily the vowel in the Ing. direct base.
697|*pħa|1741|vendetta|pħa|pħa||    5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*pħa-ne-,\i cf. Chech. \Ipħäna-,\i Ing. \Ipħano.\i
698|*ʁo|1742|help, support|ʁo|ʁo||    3d class in both languages. Obl. base \I*ʁo-ne-\i (Chech. \Iʁöna-,\i Ing. \Iʁono\i).
699|*nus|1745|daughter-in-law, sister-in-law|nus|nus|nus|    Obl. base \I*nasi-\i (Chech. \Inesa-,\i Ing. \Ineso,\i Bacb. plur. \Inase-r\i).
700|*l-aʔ-|1747|to want, to wish|laʔ-|l-|l-aʔ-|    Historically *l- here is not a prefix, but the root (with reduction < \I*=i(n)Ł̲ʷ-\i), while *-aʔ- is a suffix. Therefore the Ing. form \Il-a\i (pres. \Il-ow\i) which looks as a contraction, may be in fact an archaism (without the laryngeal suffix -aʔ- present in Chech. and Bacb.).
701|*sēsa-ḳ|1748|wife|sēsag|sesag||    Cf. also Ing. (in Imnaishvili's notation) \Isjēsag.\i In early PN \I*šēs-\i would be expected; \I*sēs-\i is a result of assimilation (regular).
702|*nobc|1749|1 bride-groom 2 son-in-law|nuc 1,2|najc 2||    Obl. stem \I*nabci-\i (Chech. \Inewca-,\i Ing. \Inajco-\i); in Ing. the obl. base passed to direct.
703|*ʒamV|1750|best man|zam-ō|zam-e||
704|*marq̇V-|1752|whirligig, humming-top||marq̇ilg||    Attested only in Ing.; possibly an irregular development of PEC \I*ṗVrḳV-.\i
705|*ʡen|1753|shadow|ʕin-daʁ|ʕi, ʕin-darʁa|ẽ|    3d class in all languages. Imnaishvili gives also for Chech. a variant \Iʕĩ,\i and for Bacb. - \Iʕẽ\i (if the Bacbi form is \Iẽ,\i as written down by Matsiyev and Kadagidze, then the correspondence is irregular: Bacbi should preserve ʕ- < *ʡ-). For the second part of the compound Chech. \Iʕin-daʁ,\i Ing. \Iʕin-darʁa\i see under PEC \I*=HĭGĀ̄.\i
706|*dād(a)|1756|father|dā|da|dad|    Cf. Bacb. (in Desheriyev's notation) \Idād\i (probably pointing to long *ā).
707|*wašo, *jašo|1760|1 brother 2 sister|waša 1, jiša 2|woša 1, jiša 2|waš 1, jaš 2|    Not clear is the voicing in plural forms: Chech. \Iwežarĳ,\i \Ijižarĳ;\i Ing. \Iwežarĳ,\i \Ijižarĳ;\i Bacb. \Iwažar,\i \Ijažar\i < PN \I*w-aže-r(V),\i \I*j-aže-r(V).\i
708|*ʔāŁi|1763|prince, master|ēla|äla|ālĕ|    Cf. Bacb. in Matsiyev's notation: \Iaλe\i (also by Desheriyev: \Ial\i), Ing. (Imn.) \Iǟla,\i Cheb. \Iāle,\i Khild. \Iēlĕ\i etc.
709|*ḳanat|1766|young man, boy; hero|ḳant|ḳant|ḳnat|    Obl. base \I*ḳanate-\i (Chech. \Iḳenta-,\i Ing. \Iḳanto,\i Bacb. \Iḳnati-\i). The most archaic form is preserved in the Cheb. form \Iḳanat;\i other Chech.-Ing. dialects reduced it to \Iḳant,\i but Bacbi - to \Iḳnat.\i
710|*ʔamgi-r ( ~ -ḳ-)|1768|one of several wives|emgar|engar||   The Nakh word has a quite solid EC etymology; that is why the Osset. \Iämɨǵɨr\i / \Iämigir\i must be certainly regarded as a loan from Nakh (despite Abayev 1958, 147-148).
711|*ħāša|1769|guest|ħāša|ħaša|ħaš, ħašĕ|    Obl. base \I*ħāši-\i (Chech. \Iħēša-,\i Ing. \Iħäšo\i).
712|*lōlu|1770|neighbour|lūla-ꭓō|lɔla-ꭓo||    The vowel difference between Chech. and Ing. is explained by the former paradigm: dir. base \I*lōlu\i ( > Chech. \Ilūla-\i), obl. base \I*lālu-\i ( > Ing. \Ilɔla-\i). The root is used also in an adverbial function: Chech. \Ilūla,\i Ing. \Ilala\i 'in the neighbourhood'.
713|*ʔārλi|1772|1 ungelt 2 ram|ēra 1|ärh 1|ajrλ 2|    Cf. also PN \I*ʔūrλ\i > Chech., Ing. \Iurh\i 'testiculi'. \I*ʔūrλ\i and \I*ʔārλi\i are probably historically parts of one paradigm: direct stem \I*ʔūrλ,\i obl. stem (with regular Ablaut) \I*ʔārλi-.\i
714|*bōra(-n)|1775|brown|bōra|bora||
715|*musṭi-n|1778|sour|müsta|mista|musṭĩ|    Cf. also Cheb. \Imustĩ,\i Lev. \Imüstĩ\i etc. The pure base can be seen in Chech. \Imust-dan\i 'make sour', Bacb. \Imusṭ-dalar\i 'get sour'.
716|*ꭓ-ārc-|1780|1 to turn, overturn (intr.) 2 to change|ꭓarc- 1|ꭓarc- 1|ꭓarc- 2|    Cf. pres. Chech. \Iꭓärca\i / \Iꭓorcu,\i Ing. \Iꭓɔrc\i (all pointing to *-ā-). The durative stem \I*ꭓērc-\i is attested in Chech. \Iꭓerc-\i (pres. \Iꭓörcu\i), Bacb. \Iꭓerc-.\i
717|*=aq̇i-na|675|thin, emaciated|=eq̇ana|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
718|*sṭam-u(n) /-i(n)|1784|thick, dense|stomma|soma|sṭamĩ|    Cf. the pure root \I*sṭam-\i in Chech. \Istam-dan,\i Bacb. \Isṭam-dar\i 'to thicken'. Cf. also Cheb. \Istamũ,\i Shar., Itumk., Khild., Akk. \Isomma\i 'thick'.
719|*=arsṭ-|1786|to fatten, become fat|=arst-|=arst-|=arsṭ-|    Chech. pres. \I=erst-a.\i Cf. also the derivate adjective (participle): Chech. \I=ersta-na,\i Ing. \I=ersta\i 'fat'.
720|*=arc̣-|1787|naked, bare|=erzina|=erzana|=arc̣inŏ|    The pure stem is preserved in Bacb. \I=arc̣-dalar\i 'to become naked, take off clothes'. PN \I*=arc̣i-no\i is historically a participial form.
721|*q-arc̣-|1789|1 to roast 2 to roast (grain)|qarz-|qarz-|qarc̣-|    Chech. pres. \Iqorzu,\i Ing. \Iqorz.\i The durative stem \I*q-ērc̣-\i is retained in Bacb. \Iqerc̣-.\i
722|*ꭓ-ōbṭ-|1790|to soak up|ꭓūd-||ꭓoṗṭ-|    Chech. reflects only the terminative stem; Bacbi, besides \Iꭓoṗṭ-,\i has also the durative \Iꭓeṗṭ-\i < \I*ꭓ-ēbṭ-.\i     The same root is contained in two common Nakh derivates:     a) \I*b-ōṭi-n\i 'raw' (Chech. \Ibǖda,\i Ing. \Ibĳda\i /irregular: \Ibeda\i would be expected/, Bacb. \Iboṭĩ;\i cf. also Cheb. \Ibwōdĩ,\i Shar. \Ibū(j)di\ĩ etc.);       b) (with reduplication) \I*ṭāṭi-n\i 'wet' > Chech. \Iṭēda,\i Ing. \Iṭäda,\i Bacb. \Iṭaṭẽ\i (cf. also Cheb. \Iṭadẽ,\i Shar. \Iṭēdã\i etc.). The pure stem \I*ṭāṭ-\i can be seen in Chech. \Iṭād-ō\i 'to soak, become/make wet', Bacb. \Iṭaṭ-dar\i id., \Iṭaṭ-al\i 'liquid'.
723|*lujsṭi-n|1791|dense, close, thick|lüsta|lista|jupsṭĩ|    The Bacb. form goes back to \I*ljuwsṭi-\i < \I*lujsṭi-\i (cf. Chech. dialectal forms like Shar. \Ilujstĩ,\i Khild. \Ilwistĭ\i).
724|*=il-|1793|to wash|=il-|=il-|=il-dar|    Bacb. \I=il-\i (by Desheriyev and Kadagidze).
725|*=uq̇i-n|1800|thick (of liquids), dense|=üq̇a|=iq̇a|=uq̇ĩ|    Cf. also Cheb. \I=uq̇ĩ,\i Shar. \I=ujq̇ĩ,\i Lev. \I=üq̇ĩ\i etc. For the pure root cf. Chech. \I=uq̇-dan,\i Bacb. \I=uq̇-dar\i 'to thicken, make dense'.
726|*=ēṭu-n|796|flat|=ȫda|=eda||
727|*t-arλe-n|1803|similar, equal|tera|tara|tarλe-nŏ|    The pure stem \I*t-arλ-\i can be seen in Chech. \Itar-dan\i 'to place, to fit', Bacb. \Itarλ-dar\i 'to compare', \Itarλ-dal-\i 'to be similar'.
728|*ʔāṭṭi-n|1804|right|ättū|ätta|aṭṭĩ|    The Chech. form contains a suffix (\Iättū\i < \I*ʔāṭṭi-w\i).
729|*ʔārŁi-n|1806|left|ärrū|ärda|arlĩ|    Chech. \Iärrū\i < \I*ʔārŁi-w\i (cf. \Iättū\i 'right' < \I*ʔāṭṭi-w\i). Cf. also Chech. Shar., Itumk. \Ierhi,\i \Ierha,\i Bacb. (in Matsiyev's notation) \Iarλiwꭓ\i 'left' (Kadagidze: \Iarleꭓ\i 'to the left, leftwards').

731|*jāqi-n ( ~ *jēqa-n)|1816|undernourished, with not enough fat|jēqa|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable Lezghian parallels.

738|*ṭq̇a ( ~ -ā)|2326|twenty|ṭq̇a|ṭq̇o|ṭq̇a|    Ing. \Iṭq̇o\i either presupposes PN \I*ṭq̇o\i (connected with \I*ṭq̇a\i by Ablaut), or else is a suffixed form < \I*ṭq̇a-w(V\i). Original vowel length is unknown.
739|*šu|2289|you (2d p. plur.)|šu|šu|šu|    For the short vowel in PN cf., e.g., Chech. dat. \Išu-na.\i The PN ergative can be reconstructed as \I*ʔašV\i (Chech. \Iaša,\i Bacb. \Iajš;\i Ing. \Iɔša\i has been transformed on analogy with \Iɔꭓa\i 'we').
740|*ni-c̣q̇ (*ni-c̣H)|1820|strength, power|nic̣q̇|niz|nic̣q̇|    5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. and Bacb. Cf. also Shar. \Inic̣ʁ\i id.
741|*s-iꭓe-n|1821|quick, swift|siꭓa|siꭓa||    Cf. the pure stem in Chech. \Isiꭓ-dan\i 'to hasten'.
742|*ḳa-l(e)|2242|down, below (adv.)|ḳel|ḳal|ḳiḳel|    In Bacb. the root is reduplicated; cf. also Bacb. \Iḳiḳlĩ\i 'lower'.

744|*=u / =a|1824|to be, is (an auxiliary verb)|=u|=a|=a|    The auxiliary verb "to be", used only in the present tense. The -u-vocalism in Chech. is probably secondary (\I*u̲-i\i > \I*w-u\i in the first class, whereas \I*-i\i > \I-a\i in other classes).
745|*=a-|1826|to do, to make, to give birth|=a-n|=e|=a-r|    A "rootless" verb (because of the loss of original laryngeal consonant) with vocalic alternations (cf. Chech. \I=a-n,\i pres. \I=o,\i Ing. \I=e,\i pres. \I=u\i etc.).

A more archaic oblique base had been \I*q̇awV-,\i whence with suffixation PN \I*q̇awV-la:\i Chech. \Iq̇ajla-=āꭓa,\i Ing. \Iq̇ajla-aꭓa\i 'to conceal', and, with an early contraction, PN \I*q̇ōlV\i (obl. \Iq̇ālu-\i) 'theft' > Chech. \Iq̇ōla,\i Ing. \Iq̇ɔl\i (reflecting the oblique stem; cf. also Cheb. \Iq̇ālu,\i Shar., Khild. etc. \Iq̇ōlu\i), Bacb. \Iq̇ol\i (Matsiyev: \Iq̇olo,\i Desheriyev: \Iq̇ole\i).
749|*ʔēc-|1840|to take|ēc-|ec-|ec-|    Cf. also with a preverb: PN \I*l-āc-\i 'to take, catch, hold' (Chech. \Ilāc-,\i Ing. \Ilac-,\i Bacb. \Ilac-\i).
750|*ħabs-|1842|to look (plur.)|ħows-||ħaps-|    Vowel length unclear. Cf. also dur. \I*ħēbs-\i > Chech. \Iħīs-,\i Bacb. \Iħeps-.\i The Bacbi meaning is cited according to Matsiyev and Desheriyev; Kadagidze gives the meaning 'send' (a mistake?).
751|*ꭓāṭṭ-|1843|to ask|ꭓatt-|ꭓatt-|ꭓaṭṭ-|    The PN length is established on basis of forms like Chech. pret. \Iꭓätti-ra\i and Ing. pres. \Iꭓɔtt,\i pret. \Iꭓätta-d.\i The durative stem is \I*ꭓēṭṭ-\i > Chech., Ing. \Iꭓett-,\i Bacb. \Iꭓeṭṭ-.\i
752|*=āq- / *=āqq-|1853|to take away, take out, pull out|=aqq-|=aqq-|=aq-|    Vowel length is established on basis of forms like Chech. pret. \I=äqqi-ra\i (Ing. \I=äqqa-b\i), Ing. pres. \I=ɔqq.\i
753|*=ōbλ- ( ~ -l-,-Ł-)|1855|to pull, stretch|=ūl-|=uwl-||    Absence of the Bacb. parallel does not allow to choose between PN *-λ-, *-l- or *-Ł-.
754|*ꭓarč̣- ( ~ -ǯ-)|1856|to choose|ꭓarž-|ꭓarž-||    The Ing. form points to PN *-a- (cf. pres. \Iꭓorž,\i pret. \Iꭓerža-d\i); long -ā- in Chech. (pret. \Iꭓärž-ira\i) is therefore secondary, due to the influence of the regular durative counterpart \I*ꭓērč̣-\i (Chech. \Iꭓerž-\i).
755|*ꭓēbc-|1857|to change|ꭓīc-|ꭓuwc-||    Ing. \Iꭓuwc-\i is an analogical building after the present \Iꭓuwc\i (Chech. \Iꭓǖcu\i < \I*ꭓēbcu\i).
756|*laħ-|1859|1 to rake up, shovel up 2 to touch|laħ=ō 1|loħa=e 1|laħ- 2|    Cf. also Bacb. laħ-dar 'to gather (fruits)' (Chech. laħ=ō has this meaning, too). The durative stem is *lēħ- > Chech. lēħ=ō, Bacb. leħ-, leħ-dar.
757|*-Vʁ-|1861|to be unwell, indisposed|ħēʁ-|||    The verb is attested only in Chech. and is probably a compound of the verb -Vʁ- with the noun ħā 'indisposition' (ħā + -Vʁ-).
758|*ḳ-orṭ-|1862|to pester, bother, bore|ḳord=ō|ḳorda=de|ḳorṭ-|

762|*=ōž-|1877|to fall|=ōž-|=ož-|=ož-|    Dur. \I*=ēbž-\i is reflected in Bacb. \I=ebž-\i 'to fall'.
763|*=āλ- / -iλ-|1823|to become, get|=āl-|=al-|=aλ-|    A very polysemic root. It is used in all three languages as an auxiliary with the meaning 'to become'; as a separate verb it can mean 'to grow; to shoot; to cross (e.g. a river); to live up to; to go away, out', with more or less the same set of meanings in all Nakh languages. The attested Ablaut grades are \I*=āλ-\i (see above), \I*=ēbλ-\i (Chech. \I=īl-,\i Bacb. \I=epl-\i = \I-ebλ-\i), \I*=ōλ-\i (Bacb. \I=oλ-\i), \I*=ā-b-λ-\i (Chech. \I=owl-\i). It is also very probable, that the short Ablaut grade \I*-iλ-\i with the preverb *ꭓ- has yielded the common Nakh verb of being, \I*ꭓiλ-\i > Chech., Ing. \Iꭓil-,\i Bacb. \Iꭓiλ-.\i     Bacbian in Kadagidze's recordings has a uniform -λ-; Desheriyev, however, writes \I=al-\i in the meaning 'to become' (Matsiyev writes \I=aλ-\i 'to become', but \I=al-\i 'to go away'). The reason for these variations may be contamination with another widely spread common Nakh verb \I*=ill-\i / \I*=ēbl-\i / \I*=ōl(l\i) 'to put, to begin/finish etc.' (also very polysemic).
764|*t-ēbč̣- ( ~ -ǯ-)|1883|to weep, bemoan|tīž-|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.

769|*=ēq̇-|1904|to divide|=ēq̇-|=eq̇-|=eq̇-|    Although in Chech. and Ing. the stem \I=ēq̇-\i is both terminative and durative, the Bacbi data show that originally it was only terminative: Bacbi has term. \I=eq̇-\i opposed to dur. \Iʔaq̇-\i 'to divide' ( < PN \I*ʔāq̇-\i).     A common Nakh derivate is \I*d-āq̇a\i 'part, piece' > Chech. \Idāq̇a,\i Ing. \Idaq̇a,\i Bacb. \Idaq̇\i / \Idāq̇.\i
770|*kēḳ-|1808|to mix, knead|kēg-ō|kega-de|keḳ-dar|    The term. stem \I*kaḳ-\i (~-ā-) is reflected in Bacb. \Ikaḳ-dar.\i
771|*kek-|1907|to stir, sway|||kekad-dar|    Attested only in Bacb., with probable EC parallels.

782|*=ōc̣-|1936|1 to weave 2 to plait 3 to tie, bind|=ōz- 1|=uwz- 2|=oc̣- 3|    Ingush reflects a form with an infix (\I*=ō-b-c̣-\i). Cf. also PN \I*ħ-ābc̣-\i > Chech. \Iħowz-\i 'to spin; turn round', Ing. \Iħowz-\i id.
783|*ʡe|1938|steam|ʕä|ʕi||    The Chech. form reflects the vocalism of the oblique stem \I*ʕa-ne-rV-\i (cf. Chech. \Iʕänara-,\i Ing. \Iʕanaro\i). 4th class in both languages.
784|*=usṭ- ( ~ -ū-)|1939|to measure|=ust-|=ist-|=usṭ-|    Ing. -i- reflects Umlaut from u (in forms like Chech. \I=üsti-ra,\i \I=üsti-na\i = Ing. \I=ista-d\i).

789|*jīš|1958|1 voice 2 song, melody|jiš 1,2|jiš 2|iš 1|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. and Bacb. Obl. stem \I*ʔāše-rV-\i\i (cf. Chech. \Iēšara-,\i Ing. \Iašaro,\i Bacb. \Iašir-\i).
790|*ṗaj / *ʔoṗa(j)|1963|kiss|oba / uba||ṗaj|    An expressive root, having, however, good external parallels.
791|*=ēlꭓ-|1964|1 to weep 2 to pour (of rain)|=ēlꭓ- 1,2|=elꭓ- 1|=etꭓ- 1,2|    Cf. also dur. \I*=alꭓ-,\i reflected in Bacb. \I=atꭓ-\i (regular durative, meaning both 'to rain' and 'to weep'), Chech. \I=alꭓ-ō\i 'to complain'.
792|*=ēḳ-|1970|to tremble, shake|=ēg-|=eg-|=eḳ-dar|
793|*ʒuʒ|1971|1 itch; tremble, quiver 2 to itch|zuz 1|zuwz- 2||    Ing. \Izuwz-\i < \I*zōbz-;\i cf. also Ing. \Izowza\i 'timid, cowardly', \Izowz\i 'coward', Chech. \Izĳz-\i ( < \I*zēbz-\i) 'to have cramps, convulsions'.

796|*[f]utter-|1976|vexation, annoyance|hüttarē|futtare||    External evidence suggests rather *h- for PN; in Chech. *h- and *f- have merged into h-, but in Ingush we would rather expect *wuttare from *huttir-. The distinction of *h- and *f- before labialised vowels, however, is not very regularly kept, and PN *h- in this root is not entirely excluded.
797|*ʔēħ|1977|shame|eħ|iħ||    Obl. base \I*ʔēħi-\i (Ing. \Iiħo\i); Chech. has generalized the vocalism of the direct base (cf. obl. base \Iēħa-\i), Ing. - the vocalism of the oblique base. 3d class in both languages.
798|*q-ērλ-|1978|to be afraid, fear|qēr-|qer-|qerλ-|    Bacb. (Desheriyev, Kadagidze) \Iqerλ-\i (pointing to *-rλ- in PN).

802|*(p)šal|1988|propolis|šal-maz|||    A compound with the second component \I-maz\i 'honey' (independently \Imoz\i).
803|*ʔulꭓ|1990|honeycombs|ulꭓ|ulꭓ||    4th class in both languages. Obl. base \I*ʔulꭓa-\i (Chech. \Iulꭓa-,\i Ing. \Iulꭓo\i), but a trace of the older oblique base \I*ʔalꭓV-\i is preserved in Chech. plur. \Ialꭓaš.\i Cf. also Pharch. \Iurꭓ\i id.
804|*ꭓān|1993|time, age|ꭓan|ꭓa|ꭓã|    Obl. base \I*ꭓāne-\i (Chech. \Iꭓēna-,\i Ing. \Iꭓano,\i Bacb. \Iꭓani-\i). Cf. also Lev. \I ꭓān\i id. 4th class in all languages.

806|*šub ( ~ -ū-)|1997|1 hill, height; boundary 2 precipice|šū 1|šuw 2||    6th class in Chech. and Ing. Obl. base \I*šub-na-\i / \I*šub-ne-\i (Chech. šūna-, Usl. \Išüni-,\i Ing. \Išuwno\i). 6th class in both languages.
807|*q̇a|1999|sin; pity|q̇a|q̇a|q̇a|    3d class in all languages. Obl. base \I*q̇i-na-\i (Chech. \Iq̇ina-,\i Ing. \Iq̇ino\i).

809|*nɦeʔ|2003|door|neʕ|niʕ|nʕajʔ-sã|    4th class in Chech. and Ing. The Bacbi word is a compound (for the second part see PN \I*sān\i). The independent root \I*nɦeʔ\i underwent in Bacbi some transformations. It is now used only as a locative derived from the oblique base \I*nɦaʔe-\i (cf. \I*nɦaʔe-rV-\i > Chech. \Ineʕara-,\i Ing. \Inaʕara-\i): Bacb. \Inʕaʔi(ħ\i) 'outdoors', \Inʕajʔ\i '(to the) outside'; cf. also \Inʕajʔa\i 'place around the house, outdoors'.
810|*nač̣|2005|oak-tree|naž|naž||    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing. Obl. base \I*nač̣u-\i (Chech. \Inoža-,\i Ing. with vowel levelling \Inažo\i). Cf. also Lev., Cheb., Shar., Ved. \Inaž,\i Khild. \Inaǯ,\i Ing. (in Imnaishvili's recording) \Inač:\i (obl. \Inoža-\i). The last two forms (Khild. -ǯ and Ing. -č:) suggest, even without a Bacbi parallel, the reconstruction of *č̣ in PN.
811|*ʔārcV|2006|1 bar, bolt, cross-beam 2 purlin|orcꭓa 1|ɔrc 2||    Chech. \Iorcꭓa\i is a development < \I*ʔārcu-ḳa\i (with a variant *-ḳa of the PN diminutive suffix *-ḳ). Length of vowel is determined on basis of Ing. \Iɔrc\i (reflecting \I*ʔārcu\i - probably the original oblique base in the paradigm \I*ʔārc,\i \I*ʔārcu-\i). 6th class in both languages.     The same root is present in the PN compound \I*duq̇-ārc\i 'stick for locking the yoke (\I*duq̇\i)' > Chech. \Iduq̇arc,\i Ing. \Iduq̇ɔrc.\i
812|*bursa ( ~ -o)|2007|a k. of bush|bursa|||    Attested only in Chech., but having probable external parallels.
813|*dVHVꭓḳ|2008|pine-tree||dĳꭓk||    Attested only in Ing. (medial -ĳ- is not quite clear: it probably points to some medial laryngeal), but having probable external parallels.
814|*jilʁV|2009|a k. of tree (used for making whip-handles)|jilʁa|||    Attested only in Chech., with possible external parallels.
815|*ʔā-q̇arV|1086|somewhat elevated plain|āq̇ari|||    The stem is attested only in Chech. and is probably an old compound (for the first part, ʔā-, cf. PN \I*ʔārV\i 'plain, field'; thus \Iāq̇ari\i < \I*ʔār-q̇arV\i).
816|*ka|2010|(good) luck (indecl.)|ka|||    Attested only in Chech., with probable external parallels.
817|*(ʔa)sṭo|2012|chisel|sto|osta|sṭo|    5th class in Chech. and Bacb., 3d class in Ing. Cf. also Chech. Lev., Cheb. \Istwo,\i Akk. \Iāsta\i (with not quite clear vowel length - to judge from the reduction in most Chech. dialects and Bacb., the initial vowel in PN must have been short).
818|*qVwe|2013|1 enclosure for sheep 2 pen, enclosure|qī|qĳ||    5th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing. Without Bacbi it is impossible to establish the quality of the medial consonant (*w,*j,*d,*b or *g).
819|*kaš|2014|grave|kaš|kaš||    3d class in both languages. Obl. base \I*kašu-\i (Chech. \Ikoša-,\i Ing. \Ikašo\i with vowel levelling).

823|*ken|2021|oats|keŋ (Uslar)|ken||    5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. Cf. also Chech. (in the Ingush-Chechen dictionary) \Ikena\i (6th class) 'oats'.
824|*qaħ|2024|cough (of animals)|qaħ|||    Obl. base \Iqaħa-.\i An expressive word, but having rather exact external parallels.
825|*gāʒa(-n)|2025|goat|gāza|gaza|gazã|    4th class in Chech., 3d class in Ing., 6th class in Bacb.

827|*c̣uc̣- ( ~ -o-)|2026|spout (of a tea-pot, jar)|c̣uzam|||    Attested only in Chech. (-am is a frequent nominal suffix), but having probable Lezghian parallels.
828|*ʁola ( ~ -ō-)|2027|some edible weed|||ʁola|    The Bacb. word is cited from Desheriyev, and its precise meaning is unknown.
829|*kēs(s)|2028|a stripe of mown corn or grass|kes|kes||    Chech. obl. base \Ikēsa-ra-.\i 3d class in both languages.
830|*c̣inc̣c̣-|2030|a piece of smth.|c̣inc̣olg|||    An expressive diminutive form.
831|*b(ɦ)erg (~-ʕ-,-ḳ)|2032|ounce, snow leopard|c̣oq̇-berg|||    A compound with \Ic̣oq̇\i 'panther, ounce' (q.v.).
832|*kust ( ~ -ū-,-ṭ)|2034|bearing, appearance, figure||kust||    Both Ing. and Chech. have also the word \Ikuc\i with similar meanings - obviously a loan from Av. \Ikuc\i id.
833|*ṭatVb|2036|silver|deti|dotuw|ṭateb|    3d class in all languages. Initial d- in Chech. and Ing. is secondary (obviously under the influence of \I*dašVb\i 'gold' - Chech. \Ideši,\i Ing. \Idošuw\i - q.v.). Cf. also Khild. \Idetiw\i id. Related is also Bacb. \Itiṭbe-r\i 'bronze'.

837|*ʁārt|2043|thigh, hip|ʁart|||    Obl. base \Iʁärta-\i (pointing to length in PN).
838|*nārs|2044|cucumber|närs|nars||    In Chech. the direct base was modified under the influence of the oblique base (\Inärsa-\i), cf. in Uslar's recording: \Inars,\i \Inɛrsi-.\i
839|*gala|2045|1 wooden skittles 2 birch-tree|gala 1||gal 2|    3d class in Chech., 4th class in Bacb.

841|*ʔurd (~ɦ-,-ṭ)|2050|plot of arable land, allotment|urd|urd||    Obl. base \I*ʔurde-\i (Chech. \Iürda-,\i Ing. \Iurdo\i) is probably recent; more archaic is the stem \I*ʔardo-,\i preserved in plural (Chech. \Iarda-š,\i Ing. \Iorda-š\i) and pointing to a short root vowel in PN (otherwise in Ing. ɔ- would be expected). 3d class in both languages.
842|*ʔāꭓ|2052|half|aꭓ|aꭓ|aꭓ|    Obl. base \I*ʔāꭓe-nV-\i (Chech. \Iēꭓana-,\i Ing. \Iaꭓane\i). In Chech. cf. also a diminutive \Iēꭓig\i 'small half'.
843|*bɦāṭ|2055|1 duck 2 goose|bad 1||baṭ 2|    Obl. base \I*bɦāṭi-\i (\I*bɦāṭe-\i), cf. Chech. \Ibēda-.\i 4th class in Chech., 5th class in Bacb. Cf. dialectal forms: Cheb. \Ibād\i (\Ibāde-\i), Shar. \Ibʕād\i (\Ibʕāda-\i), Khild. \Ibʕād\i (\Ibʕēde-\i) etc. The medial laryngeal does not allow to consider the Nakh forms as loanwords from Georg. \Ibaṭi\i 'goose' (a reverse direction of borrowing is more probable).
844|*nēcV ( ~ -ā-)|2059|maternal aunt or uncle|nēca|||    The original PN form is hard to reconstruct, because the root is attested only in Chech. and was obviously modified under the influence of \Idēca\i 'paternal aunt'.
845|*ʔa-staʁa(n) (~sṭ)|2060|lame, limping|astaʁa|astaʁa||    Cf. also Chech. \Iastaꭓ\i 'lamed person' (Uslar's recording, with an irregular devoicing).
846|*c̣ōq̇|2062|ounce, snow leopard|c̣oq̇|c̣oq̇||    The Chech. word is recorded only in the Russian-Chechen and Ingush-Chechen-Russian dictionaries (the standard source - Chechen-Russian dictionary - records only the synonymous compound \Ic̣oq̇-berg,\i and Uslar has only another compound, \Ic̣oq̇-ɛrzaw\i 'eagle'), but vowel length can be securely postulated on the basis of a derived adjective: Chech. \Ic̣ȫq̇a\i 'variegated (of animals)'. The oblique stem can be reconstructed as \I*c̣ōq̇e-\i (Chech. [in the Ingush-Chechen-Russian dictionary] \Ic̣öq̇a-,\i Ing. \Ic̣oq̇o\i). The word belongs to the 3d class in both languages.
847|*ḳunc̣-ul ( ~ -ʒ-)|2064|bald spot, bald head|ḳunzal|||    Cf. also Lev. \Iḳunzul,\i Shar., Khild., Itumk. \Iḳunʒul\i id.
848|*[č]amuʁ / *mačuʁ|2065|1 cheek-bone 2 jaw 3 cheek|moččaʁal 1,2|močꭓal 2|č̣amaʁ 3|    The word demonstrates some phonetic irregularities: metathesis in Chech. and Ing. (with expressive gemination in Chech. and assimilative devoicing -ʁ- > -ꭓ- in Ing.); unclear glottalisation in Bacbi. The Chech. and Ing. forms have a suffixed *-al. 3d class in Chech. and Ing., 8th class in Bacb.
849|*ǯ[i]rʁa|2066|tambourine|žirʁa|žarʁa||    4th class in both languages; -a- in Ing. is not clear.
850|*gul|2070|mountain ridge|gul|||    Obl. base \Igula-.\i Perhaps related is also Bacb. \Igul\i 'lump (of dough)', if we suppose a metaphorical usage of the original root in Bacbi.
851|*lo|2071|1 basting, tacking 2 (sewing) pattern|lol 1|lo 2||    Chech. obl. base \Ilala-ra-\i (-l in \Ilol\i is historically a suffix, as seen from the Ingush form).
852|*pħēṭa|1671|a village (high in the mountains)|pħēda|||
853|*ħunḳ ( ~ -ū-)|2073|to hiccup|ħünḳ jan|||    An onomatopoeic word with irregular preservation of *ḳ; cf. also (with other irregularities) Ing. \Iħaʕing-aš de\i id.
854|*ħārsi-n|2075|reddish, red-haired|ħärsa|||    Cf. also Lev. \Iħǟrsi,\i Cheb. \Iħārsĩ,\i (with secondary -c-) Shar. \Iħērcĩ,\i It. \Iħērcĩ.\i
855|*ħaqa|2077|pig, swine|ħaqa|ħaqa|qa|    In Bacb. the first weak syllable with a laryngeal was reduced. 4th class in Chech. and Ing., 3d class in Bacb. Cf. also Cheb., Shar., Khild., Lev. \Iħaqa\i id.
856|*jVrλ-|2079|weeds|jar-aš|jɔrh||    4th class in Ing., plur. tant. in Chech. The vowel correspondence is irregular (Chech. has a short -a-, but Ing. ɔ points to long *ā before a following back vowel - indicating an oblique base like \I*jārλu-\i).
857|*gērde ( ~ -ṭ-)|2080|a measuring vessel (for about 12 kg.)|girda|gerd||    5th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing. Cf. also Cheb., Ved. \Igjerdi,\i Shar. \Igirdi,\i Lev. \Igīrdi,\i \Igīrda,\i Itumk. \Igīrdi\i id.
858|*gil-iḳ / *gil-diḳ|2082|tickling|gilg / gildig|||    The form \Igilg\i (plur. \Igilg-aš\i) is given in the Russian-Chechen dictionary, the form gildig - in the Chechen-Russian dictionary.
859|*gerc̣ ( ~ -ē-)|2083|weapons, arms|gerz|gerz|gerc̣|    3d class in all languages. Obl. base \I*gerc̣a-\i (Chech. \Igerza-,\i Ing. \Igerzo\i). Cf. also Cheb., Lev. \Igjerz,\i It., Shar., Khild. \Igjerʒ,\i Ing. (in Imnaishvili's notation) \Igjerc:.\i     Nakh > Osset. \Igarz\i 'instrument' (see Abayev 1958, 508).
860|*lamo|2085|day after tomorrow|lama|lomma|lamŏ|    Gemination (-mm-) in Ing. is probably secondary.
861|*laꭓu-n|2088|low|loꭓa|loꭓa|laꭓũ|    Cf. also Cheb. \Ilaꭓũ,\i Shar., Khild. \Iloꭓũ,\i Akk. \Iloꭓã\i etc.; Chech. adv. \Ilaꭓa\i 'down, below'. Cf. the pure root in Chech. \Ilaꭓ-alar\i 'to descend, come down', Bacb. \Ilaꭓ-dar\i 'make low'.
862|*maci-n|2092|hungry|meca|meca|macĩ|    Cf. also Chech. \Imacalla\i ( = Bacb. \Imacol\i) 'hunger', Lev., Ved. \Imecĩ,\i Cheb. \Imacĩ\i 'hungry' etc. The pure root \I*mac-\i is seen in Chech. \Imac-dalar,\i Bacb. \Imac-dalar\i 'to become hungry'.
863|*mōlꭓa|2094|medicine; (gun-)powder|molꭓa|molꭓa||    3d class in both languages. The original meaning is obviously 'weed, grass' (with a usual semantic development > 'medicine' or 'powder'). The vowel in PN must have been long (although the length is not recorded in modern literary forms), because a root-structure *CŏCa did not exist in PN.
864|*nāꭓ|2095|men, people|naꭓ|naꭓ|naꭓ|    Obl. base \I*nāꭓi-\i (Chech. \Inēꭓa-,\i Bacb. \Inaꭓi-\i).
865|*bārč|2101|honorable place (in the house)|barč|bärče|barč|    Obl. base \I*bārči-\i (Chech. \Ibärča-\i). The Ing. form contains a suffix (*-jV). In Bacb. cf. also a derivate \Ibarčol\i 'ability'.
866|*māssa-n|2102|quick, swift|māsa|massa||    Cf. also Chech. (Usl.) \Imāsaŋ\i id.
867|*ʁuʁ|2106|rumble, thunder|ʁuʁ|||    Obl. base \Iʁuʁa-.\i
868|*qeṭ ( ~ -ē-)|1512|a wooden shovel (for raking up rubbish, dung)|||qeṭ|    Attested only in Bacb., but having probable external parallels.
869|*qēl|2107|1 sentence, fate 2 custom 3 court, justice|qel 1|qel 1|qel 2,3|    Obl. base \I*qēla-\i (Chech. \Iqēla-,\i Ing. \Iqelo\i). 4th class in all languages.
870|*q̇ārc̣V-n|2116|variegated|q̇orza|q̇ɔrza|q̇arc̣ẽ|    Chech. and Ing. point to PN \I*q̇ārc̣u-\i (cf. also Cheb. \Iq̇ārzõ,\i Khild. \Iq̇orʒŏ,\i Lev. \Iq̇ɔ̄rzũ\i etc.), Bacb. - to \I*q̇ārc̣i-n.\i Cf. also Bacb. \Iq̇arc̣-dar\i 'to make variegated', Chech. \Iq̇arz-\i (used as a verbal stem) 'to appear particoloured, variegated'.
871|*bʡāʁu-m|2117|pillar, post|bʕōʁam|bʕɔʁa||    6th class in both languages. Cf. also Cheb. \Ibʕāʁom,\i Shar. \Ibʕōʁõ,\i Ved, \Ibʕāʁam\i etc.
872|*daq̇a|2120|dead body|daq̇a|daq̇a|daq̇(ŏ)|    Obl. base \I*daq̇u-\i (Chech. \Idoq̇a-,\i Ing. with vowel levelling \Idaq̇o\i). 3d class in all languages.
873|*ʁabʁV (~ -o-,-V̄-)|2179|noise, din|ʁowʁa|||
874|*ʁara|2122|noise|ʁara|ʁar||    4th class in both languages.
875|*sire(-n)|2123|grey|sira|sira||    Cf. also Chech. (in Uslar's recording) \Isiri\i id.
876|*sṭā-ꭓḳu|2126|last year|stoꭓka|sɔꭓk|sṭauꭓḳŭ|    Historically a compound (etymology of the second part see under \I*Hƛ̣̲wĭnV̄\i 'year').
877|*šāṭ-iḳ ( ~ -ē-)|2127|reed-pipe|šēdag|||    The word contains a common Nakh diminutive *-iḳ. Cf. also Bacb. \Isṭiur\i 'reed-pipe' ( < \I*šaṭ-iru\i = Av. \Iišṭéro\i), with a secondary vowel reduction.
878|*tāʁV|2129|valley|tōʁē|ataʁe||    4th class in both languages. Chech. also has a form \Iātaʁi\i id. = Ing. \Iataʁe\i (reflecting \I*ʔā-tāʁV\i with a prefix).     Nakh. > Osset. \Iataɣa\i 'bank valley' (Abayev 1958, 80).
879|*tēk(u)|2130|chamber-pot|tök|tek||    The original paradigm can be reconstructed as \I*tēk,\i \I*tēku-\i (cf. Chech. obl. \Itȫka-\i); the obl. base vocalism in Chech. penetrated into the direct base. 4th class in both languages.
880|*darʁa|2131|arc (of a bow)|ʕad-darʁa|ʕad-darʁa||    A compound with the first part \I*ʡāṭɦ\i 'bow' (q.v.). 4th class in both languages. One wonders if the Avar form \Igazárʁo\i 'bow' does not reflect a compound (for the first part cf. \Igazá\i 'hoe'?) with an old borrowing from Nakh (\Igazarʁo\i < \I*gaz-darʁo\i).
881|*baq̇|2134|1 true (adv.) 2 truth, rule|baq̇ 1|boq̇o 2|baq̇eʔ 2|    In Chech. cf. also \Ibaq̇ō\i ( = Ing. \Iboq̇o,\i Bacb. \Ibaq̇eʔ\i) 'rule, right, truth'.
882|*baħ|2135|burdock|baʕ|baʕ|baħ|    Obl. stem \I*baħV-\i (Ing. \Ibaʕo,\i Chech. \Ibaʕa-,\i but in Uslar's recording \Ibɛʕi-\i). 6th class in Chech. and Bacb., 5th class in Ing. In Chech. and Ing. -ħ > -ʕ by assimilation.
883|*ꭓuw (~-ū-,-b)|2140|1 anger 2 whim|ꭓū 1|ꭓuw 2||    4th class in both languages. The quality of the final consonant is impossible to establish without Bacb. data.
884|*darc ( ~ -ā-)|2141|snowstorm|darc|||    Obl. base \Idarca-;\i vowel length unclear.
885|*=āǯ-|2144|to graze|=āž-|=až-|=až-|    In Bacb. cf. also a derivate: \Idažar\i 'pasture, grass in a pasture'.
886|*=awi-n ( ~ -ā-)|385|1 light (in weight) 2 cheap|=aj-n 1,2|=aj 1|=awĩ 1|
887|*t-oq̇-|2149|to be sufficient, enough|toʔ-|toʔ-|toq̇-|    The stem contains a preverb (*t-).
888|*lV-|2150|to deceive|lē-dan|||    Attested only in Chech., so the precise PN reconstruction is not clear.
889|*-iʔ-|2151|to ripen; to grow|q-iʔ-|q-e||    The root is homonymous with \I*q-iʔ-\i 'to have time' (q.v.) - as a result of contamination.
890|*=āṭṭ-|2152|to break, crack, burst, to be torn|=āṭ-|=aṭṭ-|=aṭ-|    Cf. also dur. \I*ʔēṭṭ-\i id. (Chech. \Iēṭ-,\i Ing. \Ieṭṭ-,\i Bacb. \Ieṭ-\i). Geminated *ṭṭ in PN is probably expressive (cf. the reduplication \I*=iṭʷVṭʷ-\i in PA).
891|*=aṭ- ( ~ -ā-)|411|to lie, lie about|||=aṭ-|
892|*ba-du ( ~ -ā-)|2157|orphan|bō|bo|badŏ|    3d class in all languages. Final *-du is probably an old common NC attributive suffix.
893|*ʔinʒa ( ~ -c̣-)|2161|wick||inza||    Attested only in Ing., but having probable external parallels.
894|*-aq-|2162|to crawl|t-aq-|t-aq-|t-aq-|    Cf. also dur. \I*t-ēq-\i (Chech. \It-ēq-,\i Ing. \Iteq-,\i Bacb. \Iteq-\i) id.
895|*dāq̇ur|2163|forage, fodder|dōq̇ar|dɔq̇ar||    3d class in both languages.
896|*=ōbc-|2165|1 to plait 2 to weave|=ūc- 1|=uc- 1|=opc- 1,2|    Cf. also dur. \I*=ēbc-\i reflected in Bacb. \I=epc-\i id. Medial -b- is probably an original "plural aspect" marker.
897|*q-oll- ( ~ -ō-)|2169|1 to create 2 to allot, provide|qoll- 1|qoll- 1|qoll- 2|
898|*ʡaꭓ-|2170|1 to howl, to bellow 2 to bark|ʕaꭓ- 1|ʕaꭓ- 1,2|ʕaꭓ- 1|    Cf. also dur. \I*ʕēꭓ-\i (Chech. \Iʕēꭓ-,\i Ing. \Iʕeꭓ-\i) id.
899|*ʔārV|2171|plain, steppe|ārē|ara||    Cf. also the adverb Chech. \Iāra,\i Ing. \Iara\i 'outside' (*'in the open').
900|*jāč-|2172|1 to be cloudy, dull (of weather) 2 to rain|jāč- 1|jač- 2|jač- 2|
901|*ʔeʔ ( ~ -ē-)|2173|plain, platform|||eʔ|    Plur. \Iaʔi-š.\i
902|*qēʒ ( ~ -c̣-)|2175|currants|qez|qazar||    Cf. Chech. plur. \Iqēzar-š.\i 4th class in both languages.
903|*ʁa ( ~ -ā-)|2176|1 step 2 interval between legs, groin|ʁa-š 1|ʁa 1|ʁa 2|    In Chech. the root is used only in the former plural form (\Iʁa-š\i) with the meaning 'a side-step'. 4th class in Chech., 6th class in Ing., 8th class in Bacb.
904|*tāmu-ri (~tōmari)|2178|reed mace|tōmari|||    Attested only in Chech., with a probable Avar parallel.
905|*ǯʡoǯ ( ~ -č̣)|2181|inner fat|žʕož|||    Obl. stem \Ižʕoža-.\i
906|*šato (/-ṭ-)|2182|1 spittle 2 saliva|šet|šod|šatŏ|    Chech. \Išet\i probably is a secondary building after the obl. base \I*šati-\i (Chech. \Išeta-\i). 4th class in all languages.     In PN there are no clusters of *š- + laryngeals; it is not excluded that in this root such a cluster had existed (cf. the pharyngealization in the Darg. parallel), and influenced the reflex of medial *-t- in Ing. (where the form šod points to \I*šaṭo\i < \I*šHato?\i).
907|*ǯa|2183|flock (of sheep)|ža|ža|že|    3d class in all languages. The paradigm can be reconstructed as dir. \I*ǯa,\i obl. \I*ǯe-\i (cf. Chech. \Iža,\i gen. \Iže-n,\i dat. \Iže-na,\i Ing. \Iža,\i erg. \Iže-wo\i); in Bacb. the oblique base superseded the direct one. Cf. also Lev. \Iǯa,\i Akk. \Iža,\i Khild. \Iǯe\i id.
908|*ʁōru|2185|powder-flask, horn for storing powder|ʁūra|||
909|*m(ɦ)uš|2186|elm|muš|muš||    Obl. base \I*m(ɦ)uše-\i (Chech. \Imüša-,\i Ing. \Imušo\i). 3d class in Chech., 4th class in Ing.
910|*dē|417|day|de|di|de|    3d class in all languages. Obl. \I*dē-ni-,\i cf. Chech. \Idīna-,\i Ing. \Ideno,\i  Bacb. \Idin-aʔ\i 'every day'.
