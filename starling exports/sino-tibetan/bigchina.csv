    The OC *k� 'father's sister' seems to have no connections in Sino-Tibetan languages. It resembles the PA kinship term *�k`a, but the resemblance may be purely coincidental ("children's word"). 
 The etymology of *k� 'meanwhile, for a time' is also not quite clear. The closest existing parallel is Tib. a~ga 'some, something, somebody', used also in the meaning 'sometimes' (but considered in this meaning to be a contraction of lan-a~ga). It seems probable that both the Chinese and the Tibetan words are derived from the common ST demonstrative stem *ka� (see under ��), but the details are yet to be found out.
